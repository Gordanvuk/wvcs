effects of metaphors on learning have been proved by many studies.
Learners naturally invoke metaphors when learning new concepts because
metaphors stimulate them to generate models of the domain to be
learned. However, little evidence has been seen of metaphors' effect on
developing learners' mental models. Since metaphors function by
providing familiar concepts that help learners to construct new
knowledge, metaphors' effects may be more apparent to novice learners.<p>This
study explores the effects of metaphors on both novice and expert
learners' performance and their mental-model development as documented
by three different measurement methods. It also examines the
relationship between subjects' performance and their mental models. The
results indicate that metaphors may facilitate novices' construction of
integrative knowledge but not simple knowledge. In addition, metaphors
may possibly have lasting effects on expert learning but the effects
may not be seen immediately after learning.</p></div></div><br><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V0D-4HYMY31-8&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5644&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=acb07b8aad15ba05a7b6c851aff642b6">SummaryPlus</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V0D-4HYMY31-8&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5644&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=aa7d0a81c2d50935f424b726c0694426">Full Text + Links</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6V0D-4HYMY31-8-1&amp;_cdi=5644&amp;_user=126317&amp;_orig=article&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2006&amp;_sk=999819995&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkzV&amp;md5=161a351548c9446e8a25713b852100e2&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf" target="newPdfWin" onclick="var newWidth=((document.body.clientWidth*90)/100); var newHeight=document.body.clientHeight; var pdfWin; pdfWin=window.open('','newPdfWin','width='+newWidth+',height='+newHeight+',resizable=yes, left=50, top=50');pdfWin.focus()">PDF (214 K)</a>

people argue that hypertext is easy to write, is hard to create by
converting existing text into hypertext, and has a massive market. This
paper argues the contrary. First, hypertext is hard to write. Second,
automatically converting a text into hypertext is, to a first
approximation, easy. Third, successful marketing of hypertext depends
on having a large volume of material that is also available in paper
form. These three iconoclastic statements are based on painful
experience, having written a book about hypertext with our own
hypertext system. To market the book it has been published on paper and
converted into several popular, commercial hypertext systems. Users of
the resultant products have favoured a combination of paper and
hypertext.</div></div><br><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VB4-45M2NH3-2N&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1991&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5916&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=e7f07d80ee1c3edb48c98a01a8b1c1ae">Abstract</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VB4-45M2NH3-2N&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1991&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5916&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=060e624c4e424094c54bb9883b2117bd">Abstract + References</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VB4-45M2NH3-2N-1&amp;_cdi=5916&amp;_user=126317&amp;_orig=article&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1991&amp;_sk=999889998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkzV&amp;md5=f908b11129e6f7bf3cfa1c04bfcb60f4&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf">PDF (710 K)</a>

article explores the effects of undergraduate students’ mental models
of the Web on their online searching behavior. Forty-four undergraduate
students, mainly freshmen and sophomores, participated in the study.
Subjects’ mental models of the Web were treated as equally good styles
and operationalized as drawings of their perceptions about the Web.
Four types of mental models of the Web were identified based on the
drawings and the associated descriptions: technical view, functional
view, process view, and connection view. In the study, subjects were
required to finish two search tasks. Searching behavior was measured
from four aspects: navigation and performance, subjects’ feelings about
tasks and their own performances, query construction, and search
patterns. The four mental model groups showed different navigation and
querying behaviors, but the differences were not significant. Subjects’
satisfaction with their own performances was found to be significantly
correlated with the time to complete the task. The results also showed
that the familiarity of the task to subjects had a major effect on

article presents an overview of different approaches to the study of
how people learn computers as tools. The varieties of learning most
relevant for computer learners and also mostly discussed by
human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers are transfer, construction
of mental models, and learning by doing.<p>Transfer from prior
knowledge is a well-developed theory within HCI. Empirical data show
that quantitative predictions of positive transfer from prior knowledge
can be made for simple tasks. The occurrence of negative transfer can
be predicted, but effects of prior knowledge that conflict with the
material to be learned cannot be covered by a simple transfer theory.</p><p>It
is generally acknowledged that users develop mental models by
interacting with a system. However, the exact nature of these models
are difficult to capture empirically, since mental models have to be
inferred from users' behaviour. In normal use, people seem to have
difficulty talking about their mental models. People express their
mental models mainly when their expectations are violated. It seems
relevant to support the forming of adequate mental models by
instruction, but the effects of such educational models are not
clear-cut. Several factors influence the comprehension and use of the
models given.</p><p>People do not learn very efficiently by doing,
because they have difficulty in choosing alternative actions, observing
outcomes, and interpreting them.</p><p>To conclude, users of computer
tools mostly learn as a result of performing a task and do not focus on
learning the computer system per se. This implies that learning new
aspects of a computer tool is more similar to problem solving than to
intentional learning.</p></div></div><br><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDC-4608TP5-1C&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=04%2F01%2F1993&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5979&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=7f325efcf5ccb43e8b0eef1196b00129">Abstract</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDC-4608TP5-1C&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=04%2F01%2F1993&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=5979&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=9c34ff1470a4bb42a77cdf7e3db7d68c">Abstract + References</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VDC-4608TP5-1C-1&amp;_cdi=5979&amp;_user=126317&amp;_orig=article&amp;_coverDate=04%2F01%2F1993&amp;_sk=999909997&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkzV&amp;md5=d99b3c4998e65dfd105024e8b76abedf&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf" target="newPdfWin" onclick="var newWidth=((document.body.clientWidth*90)/100); var newHeight=document.body.clientHeight; var pdfWin; pdfWin=window.open('','newPdfWin','width='+newWidth+',height='+newHeight+',resizable=yes, left=50, top=50');pdfWin.focus()">PDF (1545 K)</a>

aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between mental
models required by a database system, clues provided by the system to
these models, and users' behaviour in operating the system. For this
purpose a fulltext database system containing news articles about
telecommunication and information technology was used. Ten non
professional computer users participated in the study. The subjects'
tasks were to retrieve and display certain articles and pieces of
articles on the screen. By analysing knowledge needed to carry out
these tasks, the required mental models could be identified. Then,
through analysing the specific system clues to the required mental
models, difficulties subjects would run into were predicted. The
fulltext database system employed for the study operated on three
different levels of display. That is, it operated as if it had three
different modes, each level corresponding to a different mode. The
clarity of clues to adequate mental models differed on the three
levels. Most salient were clues concerning the order in which articles
and pieces of articles were presented. These clues were least clear on
the second level of display. As predicted this was also the level of
display on which subjects' performance was worst (<span class="it">p</span>&lt;0·05).
Among difficulties identified in subjects' think-aloud protocols,
difficulties with the numbering system (“record numbers”) were the most
frequent on the second level. In contrast, clues concerning the order
of articles were relatively clear on the first level of display. As
predicted subjects performed well on this level with 90% correct
responses. The central role of appropriate clues to adequate mental
models is further illustrated by examples of subjects' mental model
reasoning. In these examples three different phases of mental models
are shown to exist—a construction, a testing, and a running phase.</div></div><br><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGS-4MFTKN7-1&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1990&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=6830&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=b119d62839616c7d88f71e29732637b9">Abstract</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGS-4MFTKN7-1&amp;_user=126317&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1990&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=article&amp;_cdi=6830&amp;_sort=v&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=28491&amp;_acct=C000010338&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126317&amp;md5=a17a825ba262d142e1f14ef33fbc2b30">Abstract + References</a> | <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6WGS-4MFTKN7-1-1&amp;_cdi=6830&amp;_user=126317&amp;_orig=article&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1990&amp;_sk=999679994&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkzV&amp;md5=82f3ec46418ee3bf97c5f416f04ed8b2&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf">PDF (1565 K)</a>

<h3 class="h3">Abstract</h3><p>Being disorientated or lost is one of
the fundamental difficulties which users experience when trying to
navigate within hypertext systems. In this paper, two new metrics of
lostness are described and applied. The new metrics focus on the
effects of link-type and the accuracy of user's mental models of system
structure. In a series of studies, the new metrics were compared with
the only other published metric of lostness, the optimal path deviation
measure formulated by Smith [P.A. Smith, Towards a practical measure of
hypertext usability, Interacting with Computers 4 (1996) 365–381], and
with other measures including self-report estimates and task times. The
results tentatively suggest that some types of hyperlink have a greater
impact on lostness than others. The accuracy of the subjects’ mental
models did not correlate significantly with other measures of lostness,
however this may have been due to task demands. Based on these
findings, suggestions are made for the design of more effective
hypertext systems that minimise lostness, and a new approach to
designing such systems, based on the mental models of users, is put
forward. </p></div><br clear="all"><div class="art"><p>

<a name="toc1"></a><h3 class="h3">1. Executive summary</h3><p>The main
strength of hypertext-based systems is that they have a flexible
structure and give users freedom to browse and interact with the
information contained within them. The use of hypertext is important
since it offers an extremely powerful way of accessing and organising
information. However, many hypertext systems do not achieve their full
potential due to poor design. One of the most frustrating usability
problems faced by users is becoming lost or disoriented. “Lostness” has
therefore become the initial focus of our research on evaluating
hypertext systems.</p><p>A primary aim of the research is to develop
and evaluate new ways of measuring how lost people become when
navigating hypertext systems. Two new metrics for measuring the
lostness are proposed here. One of these metrics is concerned with the
effects of different types of hyperlinks, and the second measure is
concerned with the accuracy of user's mental models and memory, in
situations of lostness. A secondary aim is to gather empirical data on
lostness with the objective of correlating different measures. A final
aim is to make suggestions for the design of more effective hypertext
systems that minimise lostness, and ultimately to produce a new
methodology and supporting tool for designing hypertext systems that
exhibit greater usability.</p><p>The paper discusses first the notion
of lostness, and previous attempts at measuring lostness. The
differences between types of link within hypertext systems and their
potential effects on usability are also considered. Two new metrics are
described and a series of studies are reported which assess the utility
of the new metrics. The paper concludes by discussing the implications
of the results of the studies for designing future hypertext systems.</p><p>Although
the problem of lostness is one of the most pressing issues surrounding
hypertext, very few attempts have been made to try and quantify it. <a name="bbib1"></a><a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>
in the only published study to produce a quantifiable measure of
lostness, argues that lostness should be viewed in terms of degradation
of performance rather than the subjective feelings of users. She
proposes a set of measures for assessing lostness in terms of the
efficiency with which users find information in a hypertext system. The
research reported here consists of further investigations related to
Smith's lostness measures. It provides an opportunity to validate her
measures, and also assesses the utility of the new metrics, and
correlations between the metrics. The first metric weights the
hyper-links based on their likelihood of inducing lostness. It is
expected that this new measure will be more accurate than Smith's
measure which assumes the likelihood of inducing lostness is the same
for all link-types. The second new measure relates to the accuracy of
users’ mental models, and assumes that the more accurate the model, the
less the likelihood of lostness.</p><p>A number of different data
collection methods were employed to gather data on lostness. A
questionnaire was developed to enable users to provide subjective data
on their feelings of lostness. The main causes of lostness reported by
the subjects were poorly or ambiguously labelled links, confusing
numbers of links or options available, the lack of ability to reverse
and large site size.</p><p>In addition, two empirical studies were
undertaken to assess the new lostness measures. The first study
involved a number of information retrieval and mental model tasks. It
was found that there was a wide range of scores on this measure
indicating different degrees of lostness across subjects. The results
however suggest that the new link-weighted measure of lostness does
provide a more accurate measure of lostness than <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a>
measure as evidenced by correlations between scores. Although neither
measure correlated significantly, the new link-weighted measure of
lostness correlated slightly better with the self-report measure of
lostness and with total task times, but neither was significant. The
differences however, are small and this is partly due to the nature of
the domain, the hypertext system used for investigation, and also the
differences in expertise with hypertext systems.</p><p>In relation to
results concerning the mental model metric, there was a significant
difference between the mental models of subjects when tested on three
separate occasions. There was a significant difference between the
mental models of subjects after three tasks and after twenty-four
hours. No other differences were found for the mental model data. In
particular, there were no correlations between an individual subject's
scores for the mental model drawings and any of the other measures that
have been used in an attempt to measure lostness. One important finding
was that there were significant correlations between the accuracy of
subject's mental models and their level of familiarity with hypertext
systems.</p><p>A second empirical study was undertaken to provide
validation of the mental models task. A further group of subjects,
without system exposure, were asked to draw pathways through the
system. Their results were compared with the results of the subjects
who participated in the first study and it was found that performance
of subjects with system exposure was superior to that of those without.
This suggests that subjects with system exposure were in fact using
their mental model to guide their performance on the task.</p><p>The
mental model task could be used to provide the basis for a new
methodology for designing and evaluating hypertext systems. This could
be achieved by identifying if there are mismatches in the designer's
mental model of how the hypertext document should be structured, and
how a sample of users model the domain. This approach could be used as
part of an iterative design process in conjunction with other usability
measures. In effect it would be another tool in the HCI researchers
toolbox when designing and evaluating hypertext systems. The main
advantage of the mental model drawing task method is that it is quick
and relatively easy to apply. This new method will support the
hypertext designer in modelling the categorical structure that
potential users of the system already have of the domain.</p><p>Future
research aims are to apply the mental-model approach in a predictive
manner to analytically evaluate the design of hypertext systems.<a name="toc2"></a></p><h3 class="h3">2. Introduction</h3><p>The
main strength of hypertext-based systems is that they have a flexible
structure and give users a great deal of freedom to browse and interact
with the information contained within them. The use of hypertext is
important since it offers an extremely powerful way of accessing and
organising information. However, many hypertext systems do not achieve
their full potential due to poor design. One of the most frustrating
usability problems faced by users is becoming lost or disoriented.
“Lostness” has therefore become the initial focus of our research on
evaluating hypertext systems. Being ‘lost in hyperspace’ is a complex
problem, which limits the efficacy and promise of hypertext providing a
rapid and flexible method of accessing large bodies of information.
This paper addresses ways in which to measure lostness. The rationale
behind this is that if you can measure lostness, then you can identify
systems that induce it and users who are lost. Comparative studies
between different hypertext systems can also be undertaken. Ultimately,
identifying the causes of lostness will enable people to design
hypertext systems that reduce the likelihood of lostness occurring. The
research reported here goes some way towards addressing this goal.</p><p>The
bases for two new metrics will be on the effects of different types of
hyperlinks on lostness, and the effect of the accuracy of user's mental
models and memory, in situations of lostness. A secondary aim is to
gather empirical data on lostness with the objective of correlating
different measures. The underlying assumption is that if one measure
correlates well with other lostness measures, then it gives that
particular measure some degree of validity, providing the measures
actually measure what they are intended to measure. A final aim is to
make suggestions for the design of more effective hypertext systems
that minimise lostness, and ultimately to produce a new methodology and
supporting tool for designing hypertext systems that exhibit greater
usability.</p><p>This paper first discusses the notion of lostness, and
previous attempts at measuring lostness. The differences between types
of link within hypertext systems and their potential effects on
usability are also considered. Two new metrics are proposed and a
series of studies are described that assess the utility of the new
metrics. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the
study results for designing future hypertext systems.<a name="toc3"></a></p><h3 class="h3">3. Lostness</h3><p>Being
disorientated or lost is one of the fundamental difficulties which
users experience when trying to navigate within hypertext systems. So
great is the problem that it has been estimated that about 60% of the
research into hypertext systems has been devoted solely to this issue <a name="bbib2"></a>(<a href="#bib2">Dvorak and Sommerville, 1996</a>).</p><p><a name="bbib3"></a><a href="#bib3">Elm and Woods (1985)</a> describe the difficulty as:</p><blockquote><p>Getting
lost in a display of networks means that the user does not have a clear
conception of relationships within the system, does not know his/her
present location…relative to the display structure, and finds it
difficult to decide where to look next in the system.</p></blockquote><p>The
problem does not appear to be directly related to the information
content contained within the hyperspace. Elm and Woods gave users of a
hypertext system a set of information retrieval tasks and found that
the degree of lostness experienced by subjects was independent of their
level of expertise in the information domain (a manual of emergency
procedures for a nuclear power plant).</p><p>As a result of their
study, three different forms of being lost are outlined when speaking
in terms of hypertext, as opposed to navigation per se:</p><dl><dt><p>1. Not knowing where to go next.</p></dt><dt><p>2. Knowing where to go, but not knowing how to get there.</p></dt><dt><p>3. Not knowing where they are in the overall structure of the document.</p></dt></dl><p>The
problem therefore appears to be one of unfamiliarity with the structure
of the document, as evidenced by problems of navigation and location,
rather than the user simply being unfamiliar with the information
content or too entropic an information space.</p><p>A document's
structure is known to be important. For instance, research on text
comprehension in children has shown that a proper understanding of a
text depends on sensitivity to the relative importance of the ideas
within it, as well as an understanding of how the ideas are related <a name="bbib4"></a>(<a href="#bib4">Baker and Stein, 1981</a>).
It is even thought that the ability to understand how ideas are
interconnected in a text probably develops even before children learn
to read <a name="bbib5"></a>(<a href="#bib5">Oakhill and Garnham, 1988</a>).</p><p>When
users have problems discerning or understanding document structure,
they use their existing knowledge to guide them. For instance, <a name="bbib44"></a><a href="#bib44">Jaynes (1989) </a>
discusses how readers of hypertext will use retrieval mechanisms that
are already familiar to them from paper-based hard copies. When reading
a paper-based medium such as a book, a reader is given many cues as to
their location within the document's structure and how to find a
specific piece of information. It is, for example, possible to know how
far we are from the beginning or the end, which (of a series of
numerically ordered) chapter we are in, what the subject matter is, and
so forth.</p><p>With a book, we have a certain set of expectations or schema of what a book is, and of how it is comprised <a name="bbib6"></a>(<a href="#bib6">Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983</a>).
We know that we can look in the index to find out the location of
specific information, we can look on the cover sheet to see when it was
written, and we can consult the contents page to find out about chapter
headings and contents. There are certain well-established conventions
with books that we have learnt, and which are to a great extent,
intuitive.</p><p>The same may be said for other paper-based mediums
such as a phone book, a newspaper or a musical score. Each of these
provides certain cues or landmarks to indicate how to find the required
information within them. To this extent an analogy exists between
navigation through a paper-based information space and navigation in a
real physical environment. As familiarity with the text grows, the
reader becomes more familiar with the various landmarks in the text and
the relationships between them. The reader is in effect building up a
mental representation or model of the text, based on orientation cues.</p><p>These
orientation cues, which are so important for constructing a mental
model of the text, are absent in many hypertext systems and as a result
users may loose track of their location within the system as a whole. A
lost or disorientated user of hypertext systems may also suffer from a
number of other problems. <a name="bbib7"></a><a href="#bib7">Foss (1989)</a> identified the following such problems:</p><dl><dt><p>1. Arriving at a particular point in a document then forgetting what was to be done there.</p></dt><dt><p>2. Neglecting to return from a digression.</p></dt><dt><p>3. Neglecting to pursue digressions that were planned earlier.</p></dt><dt><p>4. Not knowing if there are any other relevant frames in the document.</p></dt><dt><p>5. Forgetting which sections have been visited or altered.</p></dt></dl><p><a href="#bib7">Foss (1989)</a>
categorised orientation problems into three groups, according to their
likely origins. The first group of problems is the result of what <a name="bbib8"></a><a href="#bib8">Conklin (1987)</a>
refers to as cognitive overheads. Cognitive overheads are essentially
the cognitive demands placed on the user of a hypertext document. The
user must decide which path to take through the system but may find
interesting side-tracks, which distract from the main task. <a name="bbib9"></a><a href="#bib9">Tripp and Roby (1990)</a> argue that disorientation itself will lead to an increased cognitive load thus reducing the mental resources for learning:</p><blockquote><p>If
mental resources are engaged by navigational tasks, and if those same
resources are needed for learning, it would be logical that achievement
should suffer to the extent that navigation is demanding.</p></blockquote><p>(<a href="#bib9">Tripp and Roby, 1990</a>).</p><p>The
second group of problems arises from unfamiliarity with the structure
or conceptual organisation of the network. An example of this is what <a name="bbib10"></a><a href="#bib10">Shneiderman (1987)</a> refers to as “closure”, where the user does not know the extent of the network or what proportion of it remains to be seen.</p><p>The third group of problems is thought by <a href="#bib7">Foss (1989)</a>
to be due to a general inexperience with the practice of learning by
browsing. This is supposed to result in problems with remembering the
information contained within the system and problems in consolidating
and understanding the semantic content of the information nodes.</p><p>In
attempting to ease the problems associated with user navigation, much
recent research has been concerned with the use of navigational aids.
However, whilst these aids help to locate information, they do not
directly help users in navigating a conceptual space. <a name="bbib11"></a><a href="#bib11">Mayes et al. (1990)</a>
contend that it is important to draw a distinction between
disorientation in a conceptual space and disorientation in a spatial
network containing nodes and links.</p><p><a name="bbib12"></a><a href="#bib12">Simpson and McKnight (1989)</a>
were interested in studying the relationship between the ability to
navigate through a hierarchically based hypertext system and the
ability to produce a map of the structure. They tested the subjects’
ability to map the structure by giving them a card sorting exercise
using screen dumps from nodes of the hypertext. No correlations were
found between navigational efficiency and the accuracy of the map
construction. However, subjects who produced the most accurate maps
were found to use fewer unnecessary cards. This is perhaps an
indication that they knew something about the content and could
recognise red herrings, but that the actual structure and organisation
of the knowledge was not fully known or understood.</p><p><a name="bbib13"></a><a href="#bib13">Edwards and Hardman (1989)</a>
also conducted studies related to mental models constructed by
hypertext users. They undertook studies that looked at the effects of
different hypertext structures on the user's perception of the
document. They concluded that users appear to be creating a mental
model or cognitive representation of the hypertext structures in the
form of a survey-type map or schema. This clearly has implications for
the way in which hypertext systems are structured and designed.<a name="toc4"></a></p><h3 class="h3">4. Measuring lostness</h3><p>The
usability of hypertext has been considered from a variety of
perspectives, including looking at the efficacy of navigational aids (<a href="#bib13">Edwards</a>; <a name="bbib14"></a><a href="#bib14">Webb</a> and <a name="bbib15"></a><a href="#bib15">McDonald</a>), categorisations of navigational and searching strategies <a name="bbib16"></a>(<a href="#bib16">Canter et al., 1986</a>), comparisons with linear texts <a name="bbib17"></a>(<a href="#bib17">Leventhal et al., 1993</a>), and also by looking at the relationships between the structure of information and task types <a name="bbib18"></a>(<a href="#bib18">Rada and Murphy, 1992</a>).
In many cases, the variables which these studies used as benchmarks of
the usability of hypertext, were primarily timings of task performance
efficiency, errors and self-report measures of ease of learning, ease
of use, etc. None of these studies attempted to produce an accurate,
quantifiable measure of lostness.</p><p>Although the problem of
lostness is one of the most pressing issues surrounding hypertext, very
few attempts have been made to try and quantify it. Evaluation measures
typically used in HCI, such as task completion times and number of
errors are inadequate in themselves as neither really deal with the
fundamental issues underlying lostness. <a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>
provides a thoughtful rationale of why “traditional” approaches to
assessing usability in HCI are inappropriate for assessing usability of
hypertext systems.</p><p><a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>, in the only
published study to produce a quantifiable measure of lostness, argues
that lostness should be viewed in terms of degradation of performance
rather than the subjective feelings of users. She proposes a set of
measures for assessing lostness in terms of the efficiency with which
users find information in a hypertext system. She considers that
focusing on deviations from the optimal pathways through the system is
a more flexible approach than simply counting the number of errors.</p><p>The path measures, which Smith used to produce her measure of lostness, were as follows:</p><dl><dt><i>T</i> the total number of nodes accessed;</dt><dt><i>D</i> the number of different nodes accessed;</dt><dt><i>R</i> the number of nodes which need to be visited to complete a task;</dt><dt><i>S</i> the total number of nodes visited while searching;</dt><dt><i>N</i> the number of different nodes visited while searching;</dt><dt><i>V</i> the mumber of nodes visited while verifying.</dt><dt><i>T</i> and <i>D</i>
were intended to provide information on activity and certainty. It was
considered that a lost user might be expected to access significantly
more nodes than necessary (<i>R</i>). The final three path measures are
designed to distinguish between searching and verification, based on
the notion that one is not lost when verifying.</dt></dl><p>The
assumption is that for a perfect search, a user will visit exactly the
number of nodes required to complete an information retrieval task.</p><p>Therefore:</p></div><br><div class="art"><p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="center"><td align="center" width="95%"><i>T</i>=<i>D</i>=<i>R</i>; <i>S</i>=<i>T</i></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p></div><div class="art"></div><br><div class="art"><p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="center"><td align="center" width="95%"><i>N</i>/<i>S</i>=1; <i>R</i>/<i>N</i>=1</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p></div><div class="art"><p><a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> measure of lostness (<i>L</i>) is calculated as:</p></div><br><div class="art"><p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="center"><td align="center" width="95%"><i>L</i>=(<i>N</i>/<i>S</i>−1)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>R</i>/<i>N</i>−1)<sup>2</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p></div><div class="art">where <i>L</i> increases as lostness increases. For the perfect search, <i>L</i>=0.<p>Smith's
intention was that designers should be able to incorporate the capture
of information required to compute this measure, into the systems that
they design and build. Results obtained from data-log measurements of
actual usage could then be used to identify problem areas in the
hypertext where more links or clearer cues might usefully be added.
This is quite a challenge since designers need to know the users’ goals
or intentions, what tasks the user is performing to achieve their goals
and the information they want or need to retrieve. Therefore, data-log
measurements need to be supplemented by data from other sources and
user studies.</p><p><a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a> never tried to
statistically correlate her metric with other measures of lostness.
However, she did make subjective assessments of which users she thought
were lost, based on selected records from the video analysis, e.g. user
comments and long pauses, and tried to relate these to values of <i>L</i>. Smith suggested that users with values of <i>L</i> less than 0.4 were not lost, but if <i>L</i>
was any higher than 0.5 then they were definitely lost and from a
closer observation declared 0.42 to be the critical value. Before
concluding, Smith suggested that further work would be necessary to
refine and improve her measures.</p><p>The research reported here
consists of further research related to Smith's lostness measures. It
provides an opportunity to validate her measures, and also assesses the
utility of the new metrics, and correlations between the two new
metrics. The results are also discussed in relation to user's mental
models and subsequent design implications. The next section introduces
two new lostness metrics.</p><h3 class="h3"><a name="sec5"></a>5. Two new lostness metrics</h3><h4 class="h4"><a name="sec51"></a>5.1. Link-weighted lostness metric</h4><a name="toc5"></a><h5 class="h5">5.1.1. Background</h5><p>One
of the key objectives of this research was to develop and evaluate new
ways of measuring how lost people become when navigating hypertext
systems. The first of two new metrics of lostness, developed as part of
this research, is based on Smith's metric described above, but takes
into account the fact that different types of links might have
different degrees of influence on lostness. When a hypertext system is
being designed, it is reasonably clear that if the designer fails to
take into account the different structural aspects of the hypertext,
then it is likely that the user of such a system will experience
disorientation. The same must surely hold when a researcher attempts to
design a measure of this disorientation.</p><p>Links are the key building blocks of hypertext. They define the relationships between nodes. The assumption made by <a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>
in her measure of lostness described above is that all links have the
same potential to make users lost. This may well be the case, however
links involve much more complicated theoretical and design issues than
at first appear.</p><p><a name="bbib19"></a><a href="#bib19">De Rose (1989)</a>
produced a taxonomy of link types, differentiated by the method of
linking used. Other researchers have also generated descriptions of
different link types, for example <a href="#bib8">Conklin (1987)</a>, describes referential and organisational link types.</p><p>De
Rose believes that links are divided into two main categories,
“extensional” and “intensional”. In linguistics, the extension of a
concept is the set of instances that are members of the concept,
whereas the intension consists of a set of attributes that define what
it is to be a member of the concept. Extensional links are those which
are stored and are therefore a permanent feature of the structure of
the hypertext system. Extensional links are relevant to measures of
lostness based on optimal pathways.</p><p>Extensional link types are
subdivided into two types, “relational links” and “inclusive links”.
Relational links connect one node of information to one other node of
information and no more. <a href="#bib8">Conklin (1987)</a> calls
these “referential links”. There are two types of relational link,
“associative links” which attach arbitrary pieces of documents and are
seen by De Rose as being “entirely unpredictable”, and “annotational
links”, which for example, connect pieces of text to information about
that text.</p><p>Inclusive links connect one node of information to many other nodes and represent superordinate and subordinate relationships. <a href="#bib8">Conklin (1987)</a>
refers to these as “organisational” links. Again there are two types;
“sequential links”, which are like paths and have multiple, ordered
target locations, and “taxonomic link” types which also lead to
multiple target locations but do not impose any path-like ordering on
them.</p><p>The psychological phenomenon of priming in memory <a name="bbib20"></a>(<a href="#bib20">Anderson, 1980</a>),
suggests that a link at one level in a well-designed hypertext system,
should maximise the priming effect for information links further down
the hierarchy. Therefore, the theoretical rationale for developing a
lostness measure that takes into account link type, relates to the
possibility that De Rose's different link types might prime
associations in memory to different extents, and in turn have an effect
on lostness.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, it is quite possible that
the different link types described above may offer the user of a
hypertext system different degrees of predictability about the
destination of that link. De Rose himself claimed that associative
links were “entirely unpredictable”. If the destination of a link is
hard to predict then it is assumed that this will lead to greater
lostness in the user, as it makes it harder for them to predict the
location of target information. It also makes it harder to form an
accurate mental model of the information space. Predictability is
related to work by <a name="bbib21"></a><a href="#bib21">Pirolli (1997)</a> on scent-following and by <a name="bbib22"></a><a href="#bib22">Larson and Czerwinski (1998)</a>
on the implications of scent following for web page design. Pirolli
developed computational models of scent following in very large
browsable text collections. A browser was provided to users, which
tersely summarised, and communicated, the common content of very large
collections of information. The users of such systems had to rely on
these terse representations of content as a kind of information scent
whose trail was designed to lead to information of interest. The
research aim of the paper was to develop computational models that are
able to evaluate and understand how the summaries of information
content could provide information scent to users. <a href="#bib21">Pirolli (1997)</a> does not provide a theoretical or analytical view of the nature of a “scent”.</p><p><a href="#bib22">Larson and Czerwinski (1998)</a> argue that scent conveys distal target information via category labelling. They refer to research by <a name="bbib23"></a><a href="#bib23">Pirolli and Card (1995)</a>
on information foraging theory where scent is taken to be the amount of
remote indication a user can derive, from an information structure's
design and labelling, about the relative location of a target. The
purpose of Larson and Czerwinski's paper is to investigate the
depth/breadth tradeoff while attempting to design for optimal scent
throughout different structures of a web site. They argue that
different study results reported in the literature intended to address
the depth/breadth tradeoff issue in menu design, could be due to some
information structures having a stronger scent at the top levels of a
hierarchy. For instance, category labels could have been more
distinctive at the top level. <a name="bbib24"></a><a href="#bib24">Snowberry et al. (1983)</a>
in a study of menu design demonstrated a strong advantage for
structurally grouping like objects. They specifically showed that there
were accuracy and speed advantages, not eliminated by practice, for
coherent category structures as opposed to random structures. Larson
and Czerwinski therefore conducted a study to investigate the effects
of depth and breadth and the relationship to the category structure of
the information space. Their results showed reaction times of users
were faster for broader, shallower categories with distinctive category
labels which maximised scent throughout a well-partitioned web
structure. Smith's measure of lostness was employed and the results
indicate that users were lost in the hierarchies with the most levels.
Larson and Czerwinski conclude that matching category soundness and
labelling to reflect users’ understanding of information and thereby
maximising scent strength, should augment our understanding of how best
to design for large-scale information spaces.</p><p>The relevance to
work reported here relates to the implication that the stronger the
scent the greater the predictability, and the less lost the user
becomes. It is our intention to quantitatively measure lostness taking
into account different types of hyperlinks, and this consequently
relates to scent strength conveyed by appropriate and accurate
labelling of category structures which thence dictate the structure of
the underlying information. As indicated earlier in the paper, De Rose
considered some types of link, i.e. associative links to be
unpredictable, which in the light of the above discussion means that
they had little or no scent. However, annotational links might be
construed as having a strong scent as they typically connect pieces of
text to information about that text.</p><p>In order to improve upon <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> measure of lostness it was decided to incorporate <a href="#bib19">De Rose’s (1989)</a>
taxonomy of links. Accordingly the four types of extensional links have
been weighted by the authors (and subsequently independently agreed by
an expert in HCI) in terms of the different levels of lostness that
they will induce. This weighting of the four relevant types is given in
<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> below.
</p><blockquote><p><a name="tbl1"></a></p><p>Table 1. Weightings for <a href="#bib19">De Rose’s (1989)</a> extensional link types </p></blockquote></div><div class="art"><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="92" width="688"></div><div class="art"><p>
</p><p>Annotational links are given the lowest likelihood of inducing
lostness because they link one node to one other node and the
destination node is made explicit in the link label.</p><p>Sequential
links are given the next lowest likelihood of inducing lostness. The
reason for this is that once a user is in a path or sequence, nodes
within that pathway will be chunked in the memory as a “procedural”
unit, so that the exact location and content of each individual
sequential node need not be remembered, thus reducing cognitive load.</p><p>Taxonomic
links are given a medium likelihood of inducing lostness because they
have multiple target locations and there is not the same path-like
ordering imposed on them as exists for sequential links.</p><p>Associative
links are given the highest likelihood of inducing lostness because
they link one node to one other in a highly unpredictable and arbitrary
manner.</p><p>The reason why a high likelihood of inducing lostness,
gives rise to a low lostness weighting is because these weightings are
intended to be applied to <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> metric
described earlier in the paper. Values from Smith's metric will be
divided by these weightings and clearly dividing any number by a low
number results in a high number, dividing by a high number will result
in a low number.</p><p>It is the intention that the new metrics
proposed will be generally applicable across different hypertext
systems. The generality of the metrics relates to the assumption that
hypertext systems will be comprised of different types of links with
different abilities to support scent following and predictability, and
this is directly reflected in one of the proposed metrics. These
differences might relate to the nature of the domain, the goodness of
individual category or hyperlink labels, the partitioning of the
hypertext structure, the number of different routes to a target, and so
on. We also believe that the classification of links will be generally
applicable insofar as the taxonomy of links proposed by De Rose and
Conklin are comprehensive and representative of all link types. The
link types cover arbitrary, sequential, categorical and part–whole
relationships, which are likely in our opinion to cover a wide variety
of link types.</p><p>There were four criteria for choosing a hypertext
system on which to test the metrics. First, the system had to be an
actual system and freely available; second, the system must not have
been previously visited by the study participants; third, the system
must incorporate all the link types, and finally, it should be fairly
stable (i.e. the same from the start to the end of our studies) and not
subject to daily updates or amendments. The system that satisfied these
criteria was the Wye College web site. It is important to note that
this is a highly predictable informational system. This means that the
results achieved will be a fairly strict test of the utility of the new
metrics, and that the metrics will undoubtedly fare better in less
predictable domains and systems. It is not the case that we believe
that the metrics are only applicable in restrictive, predictable
informational domains but are applicable across all systems. The reason
for this is that the way in which link types are categorised is
all-inclusive. These link types are fundamental attributes of hypertext
systems regardless of the content of the site.<a name="toc6"></a></p><h5 class="h5">5.1.2. The first new metric—link weightings</h5><p>The link weighted lostness metric (LWLM), is based on <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> metric and is calculated in a very similar way:</p></div><br><div class="art"><p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="center"><td align="center" width="95%">LWLM=<i>L</i>/(LW/4)</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p></div><div class="art">where <i>L</i> is the <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> lostness metric and LW is the Link weightings. LWLM increases as lostness increases. For the perfect search, <i>L</i>=0.<p>The only difference between this new metric and Smith's, is that once Smith's value of <i>L</i>
(lostness) has been calculated, it is then divided by the total link
weighting for all of the nodes visited by that user, per task. In order
to retain the fact that the new values will fall between zero and one,
the total link weighting is itself divided by four. Thus, if the value
of <i>L</i> is zero (indicating that the subject, according to Smith's
metric was not lost at all), then the link weightings automatically do
not apply as zero divided by anything is still zero. Yet should the
value of <i>L</i> be greater than zero, then the weightings apply as
follows. If, for example, the subject when completing an information
retrieval task, uses predominantly associative links (high likelihood
of inducing lostness) which have a link weighting of 1, then <i>L</i> would be divided by a number close to a quarter (1/4) thus weighting <i>L</i> quite heavily. If the user used predominantly taxonomic links then <i>L</i> would be divided by a number close to a half (2/4). If the user used predominantly sequential links then <i>L</i>
would be divided by a number close to three quarters (3/4). Lastly, if
the user used predominantly annotational links (low likelihood of
inducing lostness) then <i>L</i> would be divided by a number close to one (4/4) thus putting very little or no weighting on <i>L</i>.</p><h4 class="h4"><a name="toc7"></a>5.2. The new mental models metric</h4><a name="toc8"></a><h5 class="h5">5.2.1. Background</h5><p>The
second of the new metrics of lostness is based on the assumption that
if the user has a poor mental model of the hypertext system's
structure, then it is likely that they will experience disorientation.
The structure of hypertext should help to reduce the user's memory load
by allowing the user to chunk meaningful information. If the system is
well-designed then these chunks should make sense to the user, allowing
him or her to generate inferences and expectations about the structure
and content of the hypertext system. Poor chunks or categorisations in
hypertext within the levels of a hierarchy could lead to a poor memory
for the structure of the system and thus contribute to disorientation.</p><p>Not
only must the structure of the hypertext system be consistent with how
the users categorise domains, it will also help to facilitate recall
through priming. The semantics of links are clearly important <a name="bbib25"></a>(<a href="#bib25">Bloomfield, 1994</a>)
since hypertext navigation is semantically guided. In situations where
the link semantics are insufficient, users may have to combine a
semantically guided search with less knowledge-dependent, more general,
search strategies <a name="bbib26"></a>(<a href="#bib26">Richardson et al., 1997</a>).
As previously indicated, the relevance of this to hypertext theory is
that a link at one level in a well-designed hypertext system, should
maximise the priming effect or scent for information links further down
the hierarchy.</p><p>A schema is a mental model of the environment in
which we find ourselves. This model is acquired through experience and
affords us an orienting frame of reference in order to assist
navigation. <a name="bbib27"></a><a href="#bib27">Downs and Stea (1977)</a>
suggest that such frames of reference exist at all levels from the
global, i.e. the world, to the specific, e.g. a village or street.
Schemas are rapidly acquired and once we have a generic model of what a
‘city’ is and what it contains, we soon know what to expect when we
visit one. It is quite possible that experienced hypertext users have a
schema for hypertext structures, and that this might affect how lost
they become. The process by which navigational knowledge is acquired is
generally acknowledged by theorists, such as <a href="#bib20">Anderson</a> and <a name="bbib28"></a><a href="#bib28">Wickens</a>,
to proceed through several stages of development. Beginning initially
with an identification of landmarks, followed by a development of route
knowledge, leading to the acquisition of a survey type cognitive map
which allows us to plan journeys along routes not previously travelled.
This sequence may not hold for all individuals and all types of tasks,
for example, survey knowledge is better than route knowledge for the
location of objects on a map.</p><p>In an important paper, <a href="#bib13">Edwards and Hardman (1989)</a>
studied the effects of different hypertext structures on the user's
perception of the document structure. The results of this study led
them to conclude that users appear to create mental models or cognitive
representations of the hypertext in the form of schemas. The
implication of this is that, in a similar way to becoming lost in a new
city, if users form a poor cognitive map or mental model of the
hypertext system then it is more likely that they will become lost.</p><p>It
is not simply exposure to an environment that leads to the creation of
an accurate mental model. Using the example of the city given above,
even when we arrive in a new city we have pre-conceptions of the things
that are likely to be found there and how they are likely to be
organised. <a name="bbib29"></a><a href="#bib29">Norman (1983)</a>,
stated that users of new systems bring to the system their past
experience and attempt to build a mental model of the system in terms
of this experience. Research in cognitive psychology has led us to
conclude that humans impose a structure on the world by treating
objects, entities and events as members of conceptual categories. By
doing so we arrive at a hypertext system having already mentally
divided the world into chunks, and scent following is particularly
strong for conceptually categorised systems.</p><p><a name="bbib30"></a><a href="#bib30">Leach (1964)</a>
argued that our perception of the way in which the world is structured,
is brought about by us being taught as children, to “impose upon this
environment a kind of discriminating grid, which serves to distinguish
the world as being composed of a large number of separate things”. <a name="bbib31"></a><a href="#bib31">Rosch et al. (1976)</a>
sees it from a different perspective, i.e. that the world already comes
with structure and this has a direct effect on how we categorise
objects, entities and events. Rosch's argument is that the role of the
human categorisation system is to reflect perceived world structure in
a set of categories, which provide maximum information with minimum
effort. This principle she has called cognitive economy. Another major
influence on the way in which we categorise the world is who we are and
our cultural background. This is related to how much we know about a
domain, i.e. our level of domain expertise. It is therefore important
to determine how individual knowledge and expertise and cultural forces
interact with the structured nature of objects and events in the world.</p><p>What
does the fore-going research imply about the development of hypertext
systems that lessen the likelihood of users becoming disoriented or
lost? If as hypothesised by the earliest proponents <a name="bbib32"></a>(<a href="#bib32">Bush, 1945</a>),
hypertext systems follow “the workings of the mind”, then they should
be designed as such and in doing so must take note of how domains are
categorised and who it is that will be categorising it.</p><p>The
categorisation of domains should be directly related to how hypertext
is structured i.e. a neat fit between the mental models of the user's
conception of the domain and the way in which it is structured in a
hypertext system. Issues which then arise relate to who the users are
likely to be and what level of domain knowledge they possess. If a
system is designed so that it does not correspond with users’ mental
models, or support scent following, then the users are more likely to
become disorientated or lost. This is due to misconceptions, incorrect
inferences and expectations on the part of the user, arising from their
mental models, which are not met. Further evidence for this position
comes from the work of <a name="bbib33"></a><a href="#bib33">Hamilton et al. (1998)</a>,
who have conducted studies on user interface design principles relating
to task knowledge. The findings indicate that structuring interfaces in
a manner that does not support or even violates the conceptual
structure users impose on their tasks leads to detriments in usability.<a name="toc9"></a></p><h5 class="h5">5.2.2. The second new metric—mental models</h5><p>The
first problem to overcome was to develop a procedure for measuring
users’ mental models. A pilot study was thought necessary in order to
ensure that the measures of the users’ mental models were sufficiently
sharp to pinpoint any inaccuracies.</p><p>The intention underlying the
pilot study was to assess the users’ mental models by asking them to
take part in a card sorting exercise, after completing three and then
ten tasks. This procedure follows that adopted by <a href="#bib12">Simpson and McKnight (1989)</a>.
An experimental subject was asked to try and lay out the cards in a
manner corresponding with the structure of the chosen site, i.e. their
mental model of the system. The 50 cards from the hypertext system were
placed in a random order, and once the task was completed the subject
was asked how confident they were with what they had done.</p><p>This
method of assessing the users’ mental models proved problematic. First,
it was very time consuming, even though the hypertext system had been
reduced to 50 nodes, and this led to the subject becoming bored.
Clearly, this could have a detrimental affect on the quality of the
data. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, because the subject could
see the cards in front of them, it was likely that they were not only
using their mental model of the system but were also receiving
retrieval cues from the cards. Additionally, the contextual information
of the juxtaposed cards could affect the sorting behaviour.
Consequently, it was decided to develop a new way of testing mental
models for hypertext systems.</p><p>The idea behind this new method was
to ask subjects to draw (from memory) pathways through the system
beginning at the start page and finishing at a given set point. This
changed the task from recognition and sorting to retrieval and
prediction. They would be asked to do this after three and ten tasks in
order to test the development of their models. The end points of these
diagrams would be in areas of the system which they had not visited.
This means that they would not be producing their answers simply on the
basis of retrieval cues, but would be using their mental models of the
structure of the system to make predictions.</p><p>Asking subjects to draw their mental models of hypertext systems is in some respects not entirely new. <a name="bbib34"></a><a href="#bib34">Grey (1990)</a>
also attempted to use drawings to study mental model construction
during hypertext navigation to investigate lostness. She asked subjects
to perform ten information retrieval tasks from a large hypertext
system and then asked them to draw their mental model of the system
after one, five and ten tasks.</p><p>The difference between the new
method described below and Grey's, is that Grey asked her subjects to
attempt to draw their model of the whole system rather than just one
pathway from the start to a specific node. From our perspective, this
procedure had a major drawback in that the drawings for each subject
were very different. This meant that it was very difficult to make any
direct comparison between them, other than at a very general level of
whether subjects viewed the structure as linear, hierarchical, grid or
web. In the examples of the diagrams given in her paper, none of the
nodes are labelled and the diagrams do not relate to any specific piece
of information in the system. This is acceptable in that it was not
Grey's intention to apply metrics to the diagrams in her study.
However, in the present study it was important to make diagrams of
mental models more quantifiable in order that comparisons could be made
with other methods of measuring lostness.</p><p>The diagrams produced
by this new method can be quite cleanly analysed because the diagrams
will be of specific pathways that actually exist in the system. It is
assumed that the diagrams will consist of a representation of both
nodes (e.g. boxes) and links (e.g. lines). It is then possible to count
the numbers of nodes that are:</p><dl><dt><p>(a) Actually drawn (AD)</p></dt><dt><p>(b) Required to be drawn (RD)</p></dt><dt><p>(c) Correct (<i>C</i>)</p></dt><dt><p>(d) Correct and correctly placed (CCP), and</p></dt><dt><p>(e)
The number of different levels of a hierarchy correctly drawn before
they make an error (LBE), i.e. the degree of hierarchical depth
achieved before an error occurs.</p></dt></dl><p>Each of these numbers
is subsequently placed into a formula, giving each diagram a specific
score. The formula involves: Dividing <i>C</i> by AD to get a measure
of correctness; dividing CCP by RD to get a measure of correctness of
positioning; and, dividing LBE by RD to get a measure of depth of
correctness.</p><p>The formula for the accuracy of mental models for hypertext systems is as follows:</p></div><br><div class="art"><p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="center"><td align="center" width="95%"><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_005.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="24" width="328"></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p></div><div class="art">This
formula will always give a number between 0 and 1 with a score towards
0 indicating a very poor mental model and a score towards 1 indicating
a very good mental model.<p>This new metric and formula will be applied in the studies described in the next section of the paper.<a name="sec6"></a></p><h3 class="h3">6. Studies of lostness</h3><p>In
advance of reporting the different data collection and analysis methods
we employed in assessing lostness, it is important to provide a
rationale for the design of our studies. Over the last ten years HCI
has seen a significant number of meta-evaluation studies which purport
to extol the virtues of one method of assessing usability over other
methods. <a name="bbib35"></a><a href="#bib35">Gray and Salzman (1998)</a>
provide a critique of the most influential of these studies in terms of
their experimental design. The problems to which they allude are
concerned with validity and generality of the findings. They found
evidence of studies where false conclusions were drawn from the data,
where researchers had gone beyond what was investigated to provide
advice to practitioners and where statistical problems had arisen due
to having undertaken too many comparisons between groups or conditions.
In relation to the pragmatics of the studies, they found problems with
the statistics chosen, the number and selection of participants, the
settings in which the studies were conducted, etc. The recommendations
from Gray and Saltzman's paper were followed as rigorously as possible
in the studies we report in this paper. We do not believe that we have
drawn any false conclusions, gone beyond the data or provided
unsatisfactory advice to practitioners. In the conclusion we state that
usability is not a unitary concept, and lostness is only one facet of
usability. We suggest the use of a battery of complementary usability
methods and measures. In a previous paper, the second author <a name="bbib36"></a>(<a href="#bib36">Dutt et al., 1994</a>)
stressed the complementary, rather than opposing uses of different
usability approaches, which together might provide a fuller picture of
usability.</p><p>With respect to the current study, the subjects all
came from the same population, the settings in which the studies were
conducted were identical and the statistics were appropriately chosen.
In relation to instrumentation we had clear methods to be employed in
applying the metrics, and independent judges were also used. Moreover,
we believe that the basis of many problems faced by meta-evaluation
studies can be overcome by being explicit, as Gray and Saltzman
suggest, about the exact operations and methods used. We have purposely
given enough detail for instance about the process we followed and the
test system used, to allow replication by others. In effect the studies
reported here are a replication, validation and modification of Smith's
metrics.</p><p>Research by <a name="bbib43"></a><a href="#bib43">Blustein et al. (1997)</a>
investigated different evaluation approaches to measuring the quality
of hypertext links. The paper is of relevance here because Blustein et
al. assume that the quality of hyperlinks is related to semantic
similarity of the links and their targets. This obviously relates to
notions of predictability and scent following. However, the paper is
also relevant because it discusses the issues to be considered in
undertaking experiments to assess the usability of hypertext. Blustein
et al. are concerned with computer and human evaluation of hyperlink
quality as two different approaches to measuring the usability of
hypertext. They argue that there are circumstances where computer
evaluation can be used where it is not feasible or possible for a human
to evaluate the hypertext. As a result they provide a framework for
graph-based evaluation of hypertext link quality based on four semantic
similarity measures. We concur with Blustein et al. that computer based
evaluation is given serious consideration.</p><p>However, with respect
to human evaluation, their approach to experimentation in a number of
ways is either not relevant to, or quite different from, ours. Whilst
we are concerned with assessing and measuring lostness within a
hypertext system, the approach to human evaluation that they exemplify
relates to assessing the benefits of hypertext over linear text, and is
therefore not directly relevant to our immediate concerns. In addition,
the experimental design advocated is within groups, that is the same
group of subjects appearing in more than one condition with the result
that the subject acts as his or her own control. This means that there
is the possibility of range or carry over effects from one condition to
another. In order to control for this they advocate the use of similar
but different texts in each condition and counterbalancing the order of
linear and hypertext across matched subjects. However it is possible
that there is asymmetric transfer between linear text to hypertext and
vice versa. If within groups design are to be used (since they are more
powerful), it is wise to include the subjects as an independent
variable when conducting the statistical analysis. It would also be
difficult to ensure the same structure, degree of semantic similarity
and so on across texts. Gray and Saltzman state that there are problems
with using within subjects experimental designs across different
conditions and refer to <a name="bbib37"></a><a href="#bib37">Poulton (1982)</a>
for additional problems with within group designs and counterbalancing.
In our view a better alternative would have been to match the groups in
a similar manner but then exposed those different groups to different
treatment conditions thereby keeping the text, etc. the same.</p><p>In
the first empirical study to be reported in this paper all the subjects
experienced identical treatment conditions and tasks. We did not
systematically vary any factor and observe the effects. The variations
in the data only came about as a result of the analyst applying
different metrics to the study results. In the second empirical study
an entirely different group of subjects undertook the mental model
tasks in order to allow us to compare the results.</p><p>A number of
different data collection methods were employed to gather data on
lostness. First, a questionnaire was developed to enable users to
provide subjective data on their feelings of lostness. Secondly, two
empirical studies were undertaken to assess the new lostness measures.
A post-study questionnaire was also to be completed by users to provide
further data relating to their experience in the first empirical study.<a name="toc10"></a></p><h4 class="h4">6.1. Questionnaire</h4><p>The
main focus of the questionnaire was concerned with what people thought
were the common causes of them becoming lost or disorientated when
using hypertext systems. It was hoped that the results would not only
be interesting in themselves but would also be invaluable in informing
the design of the first empirical study. Beyond this it is hoped that
they would also provide information for the generation of future design
principles and also to see if they provide corroborating data or an
explanatory account of why lostness occurs.</p><p>The subjects were
first asked what their level of familiarity with hypertext systems was,
in order to get an idea of the subject sample. They were then asked
what they thought were the common causes of them becoming lost,
followed by questions regarding particular hypertext systems that they
remembered induced feelings of lostness and why they thought this was.</p><p>On
the reverse of the questionnaire was a further question about the
causes of lostness, but on this occasion the subjects were given a
restricted set of ten possibilities and were asked to circle those with
which they agreed. The reason for asking a similar question twice and
putting it on the reverse, was so that if subjects had not been able to
recall their own possible causes of lostness, the questionnaire would
still provide some relevant data.</p><p>The last question on the
questionnaire asked subjects to “circle the number of information
retrieval tasks that they would typically perform when looking at any
one particular hypertext-based system”. The aim of this question was to
inform the design of Study 1, in particular the number of information
retrieval tasks they would be set.</p><p>Twenty two people completed
the questionnaire. The average age of the subjects was 24 years. The
subject group had a wide range of familiarity with hypertext systems.<a name="toc11"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.1.1. Questionnaire results</h5><p>In
total, 52 responses were given to the questions concerned with common
causes of lostness, and the responses were grouped under 26 separate
categories. These results are given in full in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>.
</p><blockquote><p><a name="tbl2"></a></p><p>Table 2. Causes of lostness reported without prompting </p></blockquote></div><div class="art"><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_010.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="538" width="744"></div><div class="art"><p>
</p><p>The main cause of lostness reported by the subjects was poorly
or ambiguously labelled links, which was reported by 45% of the
subjects. The second highest cause was having a confusing number of
links or options available (27%). Third came the lack of ability to
reverse (23%), followed by large site size (14%). Each of the remaining
twenty-two categories of responses were reported by two (9%) or fewer
subjects.</p><p>When the subjects were asked to circle “which of the following causes lostness?” from a selection of ten possible causes (<a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>),
they circled size of site most frequently (50%), closely followed by
unfamiliarity with the domain (45%), predictability of the link
destinations, and unfamiliar words or language used (both 41%).
Expertise with hypertext systems received the lowest percentage of
reporting (14%). Interestingly, the type of hyperlink used was not seen
as being particularly problematic (18%).
</p><blockquote><p><a name="tbl3"></a></p><p>Table 3. Causes of lostness reported when asked to circle options <img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_008.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="228" width="540"></p><p></p></blockquote>
<p>The two sets of results from page 1 and 2 of the questionnaire are
interesting with respect to the comments voluntarily made by
participants versus their views when asked specific questions. The size
of the site was only spontaneously mentioned by 14% of participants,
whereas 50% acknowledged that this could be a problem when prompted.
Unfamiliarity with the domain was not spontaneously considered to be
much of a problem, mentioned by only 5% of participants, but was
considered to be a problem when specifically asked as a question, by
45% of participants. Predictability of link destinations was also not
volunteered as a problem, but when specifically asked about, 41% of
participants thought that this was an important cause of becoming lost.
This finding is not independent of the type of hyperlink, which only
achieved a mention by 18% of participants. Unfamiliar words or language
used, mentioned by 41% of participants is one finding where there is
some correspondence between responses to specific questions, and
volunteered responses, related to poorly labelled or ambiguous links.
The vast majority of subjects (77%) stated that they would typically
perform between five and ten information retrieval tasks when using
hypertext systems.</p><p>The principal findings concerning what
subjects regarded as being the main causes of lostness, will be used as
a basis for questions in a further questionnaire given to subjects in
Study 1, once they have completed a set of information retrieval tasks
on the hypertext system. For example, the finding that poorly labelled
or ambiguously labelled links were regarded as being one of the main
causes of lostness will be used to ask: “Were any of the links
particularly badly labelled or ambiguous?”.</p><h4 class="h4"><a name="toc12"></a>6.2. Empirical studies on lostness</h4><a name="toc13"></a><h5 class="h5">6.2.1. Background</h5><p>The
two new metrics described previously, essentially pose two different
but closely related questions. If lostness is indeed related to the way
in which links are used to structure a hypertext system, is this due to
something inherent about the semantics of the link and its destination,
or is it more to do with the way in which the link is applied? Does the
linking structure go counter to what the user would expect and if so,
is lostness more related to the degree to which these expectations are
confounded? Users come to a system not as a ‘tabula rasa’ but with a
whole set of pre-conceptions of how an information domain should be
structured and this is influenced by individual differences in
knowledge, expertise and as indicated previously, conceptual
structuring.</p><p>The new metrics will be compared with other measures, primarily that formulated by <a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>, which also attempts to capture some aspect of lostness.</p><p>If
the link-weighted measure of lostness provides higher positive
correlations with other lostness measures than Smith's measure, then
this suggests that lostness in terms of hypertext structure is
connected to inherent characteristics of link types. In particular some
link types, because of a greater or lesser degree of ambiguity in their
supposed destination, and lack of scent could have a greater impact on
lostness than others. Therefore, a primary aim underlying Study 1 is to
validate Smith's measures, and to assess if the link-weighted measure
provides a more accurate measure of lostness.</p><p>A secondary aim
relates to the mental model metric. Having a poor mental model of a
system's structure is assumed to be due to a confounding or a mismatch
between user expectations and perceptions of the system structure, and
the structure itself. If lostness is related to users having a poor
mental model of the system, then users who perform badly in tasks
designed to assess the accuracy of their mental models, are likely to
be those who are lost, assuming that those tasks are valid. Therefore,
it is expected that there will be a relationship between the accuracy
of the mental models of subjects and the degree of lostness or
disorientation they experience when using hypertext systems.</p><p>The
relative influence of perception over expectation of system structure
will be drawn out by looking at the accuracy of mental models after
different levels of exposure to the system structure. Other measures
that are assumed to capture elements of lostness against which the
metrics will be compared, are task completion times and a variety of
self report measures (e.g. “How lost were you?” and “How easy was the
system to use?”).</p><p>Two empirical studies are reported in this
section. The first relates to both new measures of lostness, and
involves the study participants undertaking three activities: (i)
completing a series of information retrieval tasks; (ii) drawing
pathways through the system on three separate occasions; and (iii)
completing a post-study questionnaire. The second study to be reported
is a validation of the mental models tasks employed in the first study.<a name="toc14"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2. Empirical study 1</h5><p>This study was designed to provide data relating to our research aims and to assess the two new ways of measuring lostness.<a name="toc15"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.1. Subjects.</h5><p>Twelve
subjects took part in the study, ten male and two females. The average
age of the subjects was 23 years of age. The subject sample included
both experienced and inexperienced users of hypertext systems.</p><p>In
this study the independent variables were the three metrics (Smith's
metric and the two new metrics), and the dependent variables were task
times and responses to the questionnaire items. The experimental design
was within subjects. The ordering of the tasks was held constant across
subjects.<a name="toc16"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.2. Procedure.</h5><p>As
indicated previously, in this empirical study, the subjects were
involved in three activities: carrying out a series of information
retrieval tasks; drawing pathways through the system after tasks three
and ten, and after the post-study questionnaire; and finally,
completing the post-study questionnaire.</p><p>The hypertext system
chosen, as discussed earlier, was Wye College web site. Before each
study began, subjects were first given a brief description of the
domain. Each subject interacted with a networked Pentium based PC with
the Wye College web site home page preloaded on the screen. The
subjects were given an instruction sheet outlining the study procedure.
They were then asked to use the web site to complete a set of ten
information retrieval (IR) tasks concerning Wye college.<a name="toc17"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.3. Information retrieval tasks.</h5><p>There
were two types of IR task. First, there were eight tasks set for the
subjects by the experimenter. These required the user to traverse
different depths in the hypertext structure, some of the tasks required
the location of information only two levels deep, whereas others
required investigation to five. The complete set of tasks and the task
ordering is given in <a href="#app1">Appendix A</a>. The ordering of the tasks was constant across subjects to prevent the results from becoming confounded by learning effects.</p><p>Secondly,
there were two user-directed IR tasks. These were information retrieval
tasks that the users set themselves before they saw the system but
after they had been given a description of the domain. Allowing the
users to undertake tasks of their own choosing meant that to some
degree subjects could direct the acquisition of their own mental models
of the system structure. Additionally, it was considered to mirror a
realistic scenario where users might be unfamiliar with a specific
system and its inherent structure, but have existing knowledge or
preconceptions of the domain, and could then generate further queries
to ask of the system. Having read and understood the instruction sheet,
the subjects were given the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>You
have arrived at the home page of Wye College, part of the University of
London, which specialises in agriculture and the environment.</p></blockquote><p>They
were then asked to try and think of two pieces of information about the
college, or courses offered by the college, about which they might like
to gather information. As they carried out the tasks, the subjects were
invited to give a concurrent verbal protocol, explaining throughout,
what they were doing and why. A video camera was used to record
on-screen navigation, timings and the subjects’ concurrent verbal
protocols. After each task they were returned to the start point, which
was at the top level of the hierarchy. This is one important difference
between the procedure used in this study and the procedure used by <a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a>.
Smith admitted that the failure to do this meant different subjects
started tasks from different points depending on where they were.<a name="toc18"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.5. Mental model drawing tasks.</h5><p>After
three and ten IR tasks, the subjects were given the mental model task
sheets. The mental model task involved subjects drawing pathways
through the system from the start point, to where they thought they
would find information on X (the final specified information node),
using boxes to represent individual pages and lines to represent links
between them.<a name="toc19"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.6. Post-study questionnaire.</h5><p>Once
they had completed all these tasks, the subjects were asked to complete
a post-study questionnaire, which was designed to elicit further
information about their experiences interacting with the system. The
questionnaire included questions specifically designed to find out more
information about lostness. Some of the questions were included on the
basis of data gathered from the previous questionnaire, while others
were adapted from <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> original questionnaire.</p><p>Having
completed the questionnaire the subjects were given one final mental
model task to perform. This was given to them in a sealed envelope for
them to complete the following day. The purpose of this was to see if
the memory traces making up their mental models remained after a
significant time delay.<a name="toc20"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.7. Procedure for data analysis.</h5><p>The
procedure for getting the data into a form suitable for statistical
analysis involved the following steps. First, the information on the
videotapes was coded; secondly, each link followed by the users had to
be classified and given the appropriate weighting; finally, the mental
model diagrams were coded. The first two of these are explained in more
detail below, the coding procedure for the mental model diagrams was
explained fully in <a href="#sec5">Section 5</a>.<a name="toc21"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.8. Coding of video tapes.</h5><p>In
total there were between six and seven hours of video-taped recordings
to observe and code, half an hour on average per subject. The video
recordings were used to record on-screen navigation, task times and the
subjects’ concurrent verbal protocols.</p><p>In order to calculate both <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a>
and the link weighted measure of lostness it was necessary to identify
from the video tapes, exactly which nodes the individual subjects had
visited and the links which they used to get there. This was undertaken
for each IR task.</p><p>During the analysis of the video-tapes, any
comments made by subjects while carrying out their IR tasks relating to
lostness were noted in order to provide some qualitative data.<a name="toc22"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.2.9. Calculating link weightings.</h5><p>Calculating
link weightings accurately was an important part of the analysis
procedure. These weightings would later be applied to the information
taken from the analysis of the video-data. The data consisted of which
links each subject had used when navigating the hypertext system, and
this data would be used to calculate the link weighted measure of
lostness.</p><p>Overall the process was an objective one and involved checking each link used by subjects in the study against <a href="#bib19">De Rose’s (1989)</a> taxonomy. <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>
below shows examples of links within the system, the type to which they
have been assigned, and the associated weighting. Further examples of
weightings of links used by subjects in the study are given in <a href="#app2">Appendix B</a>.
The Wye college site used in this study, comprised mainly taxonomic
(medium likelihood of inducing lostness, weighting 2/4) and
annotational (low likelihood of inducing lostness, weighting 4/4)
links. This is likely to be due in part to the nature of the domain.
The implications of the link-types in the domain is that the
link-weighted lostness measure, as indicated in <a href="#sec51">Section 5.1</a>
will be less effective than it might have been if there had been many
associative (high likelihood of lostness) links. Therefore, any
findings which indicate that it provides a higher positive correlation
with other lostness measures in this study, are a fairly conservative
estimate of its utility.
</p><blockquote><p><a name="tbl4"></a></p><p>Table 4. Examples of link labels, types and weightings <img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_011.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="111" width="552"></p><p></p></blockquote>
<p>It is not possible to guess the link type from the link label, since
it depends at least in part on the information in the destination node.
Occasionally, there is a difference between what the link suggests its
type is, and what it actually is. For example, there is a link called
‘back to index page’ which would be classified as taxonomic. In fact,
it is inappropriately labelled and takes the user to a map and is
therefore annotational. This is problematic for scoring purposes.
Should links be scored in relation to what they actually are, in terms
of where they take the user, or scored in terms of what they suggest?
In order to ensure the validity of the link typing it was necessary to
identify whether other HCI experts agree with the way in which <a href="#bib19">De Rose’s (1989)</a>
classification has been applied in each case. It was therefore
important to get an independent judge to apply the weighting system for
the site in question.</p><p>An expert in HCI was given the original paper (<a href="#bib19">De Rose, 1989</a>)
and asked to pay particular attention to the link taxonomy and how it
might apply to link types. They were then given the web site address to
enable access to the site used in the main study, a list of all the
links which the subjects used in the main study, and asked to classify
them in terms of De Rose's link taxonomy.</p><p>When the two sets of
weightings for the same set of links were compared there were only
three out of a total of 54 links where there was any difference between
the two evaluations. The two evaluators discussed these differences
once the evaluations were complete, and agreement was reached on each.</p><p>The
differences were all centred around the nature of the links to a
‘non-clickable’ image map of the university campus. The independent
evaluator assumed incorrectly that it was possible to click on the
‘Department of Engineering’ as seen on the map, and this would be a
link to that department, which would make actually clicking on the map
taxonomic instead of annotational. In the light of this error it was
agreed that this link was annotational. As the map was divided into two
sections, this accounted for two of the differences between the
evaluations. The third difference was also due to the nature of the
map. The independent evaluator had seen the link to the map page (as
opposed to actually clicking on the map itself) as being annotational.
It was agreed through discussion that since the map was in two sections
the link had to be taxonomic.</p><p>All the data were then in a format
appropriate for comparing with the other variables, the questionnaire
responses and task times.</p><p>In the next section the results for the
individual measures in terms of their range and averages will be
discussed. The results for the mental model tasks will be discussed as
a subsection of this. This will be followed by analysis of results
relating to the research aims, and the section will end with a
discussion of other interesting findings from the study.<a name="toc23"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.3. Study 1 results</h5><p>First,
the results of the IR tasks will be given, followed by results for the
post-study questionnaire, and the mental model tasks.<a name="toc24"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.3.1. Information retrieval task results.</h5><p>The table of means below (<a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>)
demonstrates that the average Link Weighted Lostness value was 0.44.
There was a wide range of scores on this measure indicating different
degrees of lostness across subjects. The individual scores on the Link
Weighted Lostness Measure are given in <a href="#app3">Appendix C</a>.
The average for Smith's lostness value was 0.26. This value was
inevitably lower than the new measure because of the weightings. As
expected, given the relationship between Smith's measure and the new
lostness measure, the same subjects were lost according to both
measures. In terms of task times, there was a ten minute difference
between the fastest and the slowest subjects. It is important to note
that task times include the time taken to provide concurrent protocols,
and are therefore only indicative of realistic task times. People who
reported themselves as lost took a longer time to undertake the tasks,
which indicates that lostness is the cause of the longer task times
whether or not that time is taken up by providing a protocol on how
lost users feel, or in their attempts to overcome their lostness. The
average total task time was 22 minutes and 43 seconds.

Averages, minimums, maximums and standard deviations for key variables </p></blockquote></div><div class="art"><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_004.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="266" width="1040"></div><div class="art"><p>
<a name="toc25"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.3.2. Post-study questionnaire results.</h5><p>For the results of the post-study questionnaire, please refer to <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a> below. All questions were scored out of 10.</p><p>When
asked “How lost or disorientated did you feel overall?” the mean
response was 3.83. However, the mean conceals wide variation in user's
subjective reports of being lost. There was a wide range of values for
this important question ranging from 2 (not very lost) to 8 (very lost).</p><p>On
average slightly more subjects stated that they tried to keep a mental
note of where they were in the system, than those who did not. In
general, subjects found it fairly easy to learn how to use the system
(mean=6.42), and fairly easy to find the information needed
(mean=5.92). The start page was found to be fairly helpful (mean=5.83).
The subjects found it very easy to return to the start page (mean=8.67)
and fairly easy to go back from whence they had come (mean = 6.58).</p><p>There was a wide range of familiarity with hypertext systems within the subject sample.<a name="toc26"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.3.3. Mental model task results.</h5><p>The
mental model diagrams that the subjects produced were, as requested,
all box and line diagrams. The new method of measuring mental model
accuracy produced a full range of scores from 0 to 1. The mean scores
across all subjects were .47 after the completion of three tasks, .68
after the completion of ten tasks and .8 after 24 hours. The purpose of
testing the accuracy of subject's mental models after 24 hours was to
see if the memory traces, which formed the basis of the mental models
of system structure, remained after a significant time delay. The
results suggest that this was the case.</p><p>A repeated measures
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to test whether there were
any differences between the accuracy of the mental models of the
subjects after three tasks (mean=0.47), ten tasks (mean=0.68) and
twenty four hours (mean=0.8). This test was chosen not only because it
is robust to violations of its assumptions but also because the data
appeared to have homogeneity of variance and to be normally
distributed. There was a significant difference between the mental
models of subjects when tested at the three points (<i>F</i>=5.71, df=2, <i>p</i>&lt;.01). The direction of these differences suggests that the subjects' mental models of the system are improving.</p><p>Three
related one way t-tests were then performed on this data, which showed
that there was a significant difference between the mental models of
subjects after three tasks (mean=0.47) and after twenty four hours
(mean=0.8) (<i>t</i>=4.88, with df 11, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). No other differences were found for the mental model data.</p><p>These
results lead us to ask questions about the task and the mental models
the users are developing. Why, for instance, did the mental models
improve over a 24&nbsp;h delay? Could this be due to increasing
familiarity with the particular hypertext system chosen, or with
hypertext structures in general where more learning could occur as a
result of consuming less mental resources on navigation (<a href="#bib9">Tripp and Roby, 1990</a>)?
Does the 24&nbsp;h delay allow users to re-conceptualise and mentally
practice their experiences with the hypertext system? Alternatively,
the results could be a consequence of an experimental artefact, that
is, that the task of producing the drawn mental models has become
easier and this accounts for the improvements. These questions will be
returned to at the end of <a href="#sec6">Section 6</a>, and provided the motivation for the second empirical study which was designed as a validation of the mental models task.<a name="toc27"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.3.4. The drawings.</h5><p>A
secondary aim of the study was to investigate whether there would be a
relationship between the accuracy of the subjects’ mental models, and
the degree of lostness or disorientation which users experience when
using hypertext systems. The study was designed to test this and the
results are given below.</p><p>There were no correlations between an
individual subject's scores for the mental model drawings and any of
the other measures that have been used in an attempt to measure
lostness. A number of possible explanations for this finding are
discussed in detail in the <a href="#sec624">General results section</a>.</p><p>One
important finding, related to our questions about the validity of the
mental model task, did arise from this study. The results revealed that
there were significant correlations between the accuracy of subject's
mental models and their level of familiarity with hypertext systems.
This finding was found after three tasks (<i>r</i>=0.62, <i>p</i>=0.016) and also after 24 hours (<i>r</i>=0.5, <i>p</i>=0.05).
It is also the case that subjects producing a high (correct) mental
model score achieved a low self-report score of lostness, and vice
versa.</p><h5 class="h5"><a name="sec624"></a>6.2.4. General results</h5><a name="toc28"></a><h5 class="h5">6.2.4.1. Results relating to the link-weighted measure of lostness.</h5><p>In
order to provide an assessment of whether the link-weighted lostness
measure is a more accurate measure of lostness, analyses were performed
correlating the variables under examination with each other. Spearman's
Rho tests were used, as the data was ordinal rather than interval or
ratio.</p><p>There is some tentative evidence to suggest that the
link-weighted measure of lostness provides a more accurate measure of
lostness than <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a> measure as evidenced
by correlations between scores. Although neither measure correlated
significantly, the link-weighted measure of lostness correlated
slightly better (<i>r</i>=0.47, <i>p</i>=0.061) with the self-report measure of lostness (i.e. how lost did you feel overall?) than Smith's (<i>r</i>=0.4, <i>p</i>=0.097).
It also correlated slightly better with total task times than Smith's,
but again neither were significant. The differences however, are small
and might be attributable to the nature of the domain, the hypertext
system used for investigation, and also the differences in expertise
with hypertext systems.</p><p><a href="#tbl6">Table 6</a> below shows
the variables that correlated significantly with the link-weighted
measure of lostness. The highest correlation was between the new
measure and Smith's measure (<i>r</i>=0.96, <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001), which
was expected as other than the link weightings, the two measures are
identical. This high correlation also reflects the fairly low
likelihood of lostness induced by the predictable nature of the
hyperlink types in the informational hypertext system used in our
empirical study. If the links had been primarily associative and
taxonomic then the correlation could have been much lower.
</p><blockquote><p><a name="tbl6"></a></p><p>Table 6. Significant correlations between the link weighted measure of lostness and other variables </p></blockquote></div><div class="art"><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_006.gif" alt="Image" align="absbottom" border="0" height="111" width="604"></div><div class="art"><p>
</p><p>One key finding of interest was the high correlation between the
new measure and the subjects’ response to the question in the
questionnaire regarding whether they tried to keep a mental note of
where they were in the system while using it (<i>r</i>=0.56, <i>p</i>=0.028). This provides some tentative support for a relationship between lostness and mental models.</p><p>There
were negative correlations between the link weighted measure and the
questions ‘How easy did you find it to reverse/go back?’ and ‘How
helpful was the start page?’ (for both, <i>r</i>=−0.54, <i>p</i>=0.034).
This lends some validity to the measure, as both of these are crucial
to navigation. It is reasonable to suggest that subjects with
navigational problems or subjects who do not find the navigational
tools helpful, are more likely to get lost. Both metrics suggest that
there was a wide range of values of lostness, with the new metric
inevitably giving higher values in all cases.</p><p>One of the aims of
this research was to collect both qualitative and quantitative data on
lostness. The post-study questionnaire provided useful and informative
data on the relationships between factors that may influence lostness.</p><p>Self-report
measures, such as the responses given by subjects to the questionnaire,
can be unreliable. For example, confidence judgements in
decision-making tasks are known to have no relationship to the accuracy
of those decisions <a name="bbib38"></a>(<a href="#bib38">Otter and Vrij, 1995</a>).
In many cases such as in the case of attempting to measure lostness,
where there is no definitive measure, self-reports provide an important
benchmark.</p><p>Subjects’ responses to the question ‘How lost or
disorientated did you feel overall’, which was one of the key
questions, correlated with the following:<br><a name="1"></a><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_007.gif" alt="Full Size Table" align="bottom" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br></p><p>There were also correlations between ‘How frustrating was the system to use?’ and:<br><a name="2"></a><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_003.gif" alt="Full Size Table" align="bottom" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br></p><p>‘How easy was the system to learn’, correlated with:<br><a name="3"></a><img src="otter&amp;johnson_files/0_009.gif" alt="Full Size Table" align="bottom" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br></p><p>In
addition to the correlations mentioned above, ‘How easy was it to find
information?’ correlated with ‘How helpful was the start page’ (<i>r</i>=0.63, <i>p</i>=0.014).<a name="toc29"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.5. Empirical Study 2: validation of mental model tasks</h5><p>A
low score on the mental model tasks could well be a reflection of a
poor mental model of the hypertext system. This is the assumption on
which the mental model tasks are based. However, a low score could be
due to a number of other variables, such as boredom or not fully
understanding the task demands, but most importantly it could be due to
the invalidity of the drawing task as a measure of mental models.</p><p>In
order to check the validity of the mental model tasks given to subjects
in the previous study, it was decided to give exactly the same set of
tasks to a new set of subjects who had not used nor seen the Wye
college web site. In effect, we were asking them to guess the location
of the information given the domain. It would then be possible to
compare the two sets of results for the mental model tasks to see if
there were any differences between them. The findings will also shed
some light on how well-designed and structured the Wye College site is,
and how predictable the links. In addition, it will be possible to
provide data which may shed light on why the mental models improved
significantly after three tasks and a 24 hour delay.</p><p>If there
were no differences between the mental models of subjects with system
exposure and those without, then the validity of the earlier results
could be questioned. The findings could be explained in terms of the
demand characteristics of the tasks. However, if differences are found
between the mental models of exposed versus non-exposed subjects then
this supports the hypothesis that use of the system does provide the
subjects with a mental model of the kind represented in the drawings
they produce.<a name="toc30"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.5.1. Subjects.</h5><p>Twelve
subjects took part in this study, nine male and three female. The
average age of the subjects was 24 years of age. None of the subjects
from Study 1 took part in Study 2.<a name="toc31"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.5.2. Procedure.</h5><p>Subjects
were given the same three mental model task sheets as for study 1. The
only difference was that subjects in this study were asked to imagine
how the site would be structured even though they had never seen it.
Before beginning the subjects were allowed to ask the experimenter any
relevant questions that would help them to clarify the nature of the
task that they had been set.<a name="toc32"></a></p><h5 class="h5">6.2.5.3. Results.</h5><p><a href="#tbl7">Table 7</a>
below shows the mean scores on the three mental model tasks for
subjects with and without system exposure. For all three tasks the
performance of subjects with system exposure was superior to that of
those without.

<p>Three independent <i>t</i>-tests were performed on the data. This

two data sets, the data satisfied the criteria of an interval scale of
measurement, and different subjects were used in the two conditions.</p><p>All three of the <i>t</i>-tests
were significant. There were significant differences between subjects
with and without system exposure in the accuracy of their mental model
drawings for all three mental model tasks. For mental model task 1: <i>t</i>=8.38 (df 11, <i>p</i>&lt;0.005). For mental model task 2: <i>t</i>=2.24 (df 11, <i>p</i>&lt;0.05). For mental model task 3: <i>t</i>=3.54 (df 11, <i>p</i>&lt;0.01).</p><p>As
indicated previously, the motivation underlying this second empirical
study was to investigate the validity of the mental models task, and to
provide an account of why the mental models task results improved after
a 24&nbsp;h time delay. Three accounts were considered; increasing
experience with hypertext systems, re-conceptualisation of their
understanding and experiences of the system, and the task being an
experimental artefact. Before considering each of these accounts it is
necessary to consider the differences between the group with exposure
and those without.</p><p>The groups without system exposure are using
their existing knowledge and pre-conceptions about the domain to guide
their task. Therefore, they have some predictable (given the domain
chosen) knowledge about the information content but not of how the
information is structured and partitioned within the hypertext system.
This was reflected in the mental model task results. Essentially, they
are using their existing knowledge and conceptual structuring of the
domain to guide them in designing pathways (i.e. how the system is
structured). However, they are receiving no confirmation or feedback on
whether or not they are correct.</p><p>In contrast, the groups with
system exposure not only have their existing knowledge of the domain to
guide them, but also knowledge, through exposure, of the hypertext
system structure and have had the benefit of their existing knowledge
being confirmed or rejected. It is possible that they are building up
mental models using nodes as landmarks, they are able to test
hypotheses about their intuitions and expectations and also receive
feedback. The mental resources they consume in navigating through the
hypertext structure lessens, thus leaving more resources for learning.</p><p>The
three accounts generated each provide a partial explanation of the
results. It is likely that familiarity with the hypertext system
partially accounted for the improvements experienced by the group with
system exposure, both through experience with the system and the
re-allocation of the mental resources used for navigating to learning.
It is also the case that they come to learn the system better and have
a more accurate mental model as a result of further exposure as
evidenced by the rise in scores from task 1 (=0.47) to task 2 (=0.67).
The corresponding rise in the group without exposure was 0.39–0.41. As
indicated there were significant differences between the two groups for
all three mental model tasks. This indicates that the groups with
exposure were developing mental models and were using these in the
mental model tasks. In this sense the mental model tasks were a valid
measure. However, the nature of the mental model tasks also provided a
partial explanation for the results, that is, the subjects in both
groups were getting better at undertaking the tasks, and/or the tasks
were becoming simpler. We can make this conclusion because the scores
for both groups increased by the same amount over the 24&nbsp;h delay
period (the increase is 0.13) but greater for the group without
exposure in proportion to their initial scores. Therefore, system
exposure makes a difference to how well the groups do throughout the
tasks but training in the mental model task accounts for much of the
increase in scores over the 24&nbsp;h time delay. It is obvious that
further systematic investigation must be carried out to identify the
origin of the higher scores, i.e. did they each become more correct
with establishing actual nodes, their position in the hypertext
structure, their level of depth, and so on. It is also obvious that
training on the tasks is vital, and we do not have any satisfactory
explanatory account as to why the task suddenly becomes more simple for
both groups with a delay period.<a name="toc33"></a></p><h3 class="h3">7. Discussion and implications</h3><p>First,
the results of the studies are summarised and then more general issues
relating to this research are discussed. Both of the following sections
concentrate on the implications that these findings have in terms of an
advancement of theory, and of producing methods for the design of
hypertext systems, which lessen the likelihood that users will become
lost.</p><p>With respect to the difference between <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a>
measure of lostness and the link-weighted measure of lostness, it was
found that the link-weighted measure of lostness correlated slightly
better with other variables also assumed to be associated with
lostness. In particular, the new measure correlated better with
self-reports of how lost subjects felt overall and with task times.
This provides tentative evidence to suggest that different types of
hyperlinks do induce different degrees of lostness, especially for
subjects relatively unfamiliar with hypertext systems. Even in a
hypertext system with mainly annotational and taxonomic links, (in this
respect a low and medium likelihood of inducing lostness and
correspondingly low and medium scent strength), there was some evidence
that the semantics of links do have some impact. We postulate that the
nature of the connection between the link semantics and lostness
appears to be related to the degree of predictability about the
destination of that link, and this relates to how well the user is
supported in following a scent.</p><p>The main implication of this
suggestion is not that hypertext systems should be built and structured
in a way that excludes the use of the link types (e.g. the “entirely
unpredictable” associative links (<a href="#bib19">De Rose, 1989</a>))
most likely to cause lostness. To suggest this would be both unwise and
unnecessary since certain domains are quite likely to be structured in
a way that necessitates their use, as are some user tasks. To proscribe
the use of certain types of link would be counter-productive, as one of
the great strengths of hypertext is the flexibility it offers for
structuring information.</p><p>The real implication of this suggestion
is that the use of associative links in particular, should be avoided
where they are not strictly necessary, where their use is not directly
tied to task demands, or the inherent structure of information within
the domain. Because taxonomic links connect one node of information to
many others, they can also be problematic and care should be taken in
assigning an appropriate link label to reflect category structure of
the information, and thereby maximise predictability and scent
following ability. A new way in which designers can be assisted in this
particular task is presented in the general discussion and conclusion
section.</p><p>The results from the pre-study questionnaire showed that
people regard poorly or ambiguously labelled links as one of the main
causes of lostness. This viewpoint seems to be supported by literature
on scent following <a href="#bib22">Larson and Czerwinski (1998)</a>
and the results of the main study. Designers of hypertext systems
should consider the semantics of the link labels with great care as
poor link labelling can mean that users find it difficult to tell which
links are relevant to their task. There is nothing new in this
recommendation, indeed it is fairly intuitive. What this study suggests
however, is that for some types of link accurate labelling is even more
crucial than for others, i.e. predictability and scent following are
not equal across link types.</p><p>The purpose of trying to measure
lostness as accurately as possible is so that this measure can then be
used as a benchmark of usability. Early iterations of designs can be
compared with later versions to assess the influence of design changes
on lostness. Data logs could be used, in conjunction with other
empirical methods, to identify where users were lost and ideally,
redesigns could be based on improving the problematic areas. We
appreciate that identifying where users become lost, what factors led
to them becoming lost, and how to overcome the problem is a major
undertaking. However, providing ways of measuring lostness, in a
systematic and sensitive manner, is a step in the right direction.</p><p><a href="#bib1">Smith (1996)</a> observed from her results that values of <i>L</i> less than 0.4 corresponded to experimental subjects who were not lost and that where <i>L</i>
was greater than 0.5 the subjects were definitely lost. This in itself
could be used as a benchmark figure for design. In Smith's study,
closer observation of subject's behaviour on the video record, showed
that with all values of 0.42 or more there was evidence of lostness.</p><p>The results of this present research include one instance where <i>L</i>=0.41
and the video evidence shows that at least on some tasks the subject in
question, appeared to be lost. This user commented “I don't really
know” having returned to the start point three times, before eventually
completing the task in 5.23 minutes (average for task is
2.39&nbsp;min). The exact specification of a level of <i>L</i> or LWLM over which users are lost, does not make much practical sense. A band of values for <i>L</i>,
i.e. 0.4–0.5 is perhaps more appropriate. For LWLM a corresponding
range of values is harder to offer as it clearly depends on the type of
links being used. Yet since the two metrics are scaled against one
another and since both are measured between 0 and 1, the same range of
between 0.4 and 0.5 could be used as a benchmark over which it is
likely that the user is lost.</p><p>It was expected that there would be
a relationship between the accuracy of the mental models of subjects
and their degree of lostness. However, there were no correlations
between the subject's scores for the mental model drawings and any of
the other measures that were used in an attempt to measure lostness.</p><p>There
are at least two possible conclusions that can be drawn from this
finding. Either the result is due to problems with the mental model
tasks themselves, or the subjects were not producing mental models of
system structure of the kind that the mental model tasks were designed
to measure. It is quite possible that there are problems with the
mental model tasks as they currently stand. The task involves a mixture
of prediction and to a lesser extent, memory. Subjects are asked to
predict and draw pathways to specific information in a hypertext system
structure, based on limited knowledge of that structure.</p><p>Inaccurate
mental model diagrams could be due to a number of factors. One factor
relates to the design of the particular hypertext system chosen. For
instance, if the system does not constitute predictable links, then the
prediction aspects of the task will be particularly difficult. This
observation leads us to another possible explanation for the lack of a
relationship between the accuracy of mental models and the degree of
lostness. The results could be related to the “goodness” of the design
of the hypertext system. It is quite possible that it is easier to
conceptualise, make predictions about, and draw pathways through
well-designed systems. Conversely, it is likely to be much harder to
construct and generate mental models of poorly designed systems that do
not concur with user expectations. The results, as expected, highlight
problems with the design of the hypertext system chosen, given the
predictable nature of the domain.</p><p>Another factor that could
result in inaccurate mental model diagrams could be due to subjects
misunderstanding what exactly was required of them. For example, it may
have been the case that there was some confusion as to whether the
subjects felt they ought to draw ‘how the system was’, versus ‘how they
thought it ought to be’. Additionally, some subjects may have found
this task harder than others, and therefore, the mental model score
given to subjects may have been more an indication of their ability to
understand and carry out task demands than the accuracy of their mental
models of the system structure.</p><p>One result from the study, which
lends support to this, is the finding of a significant correlation
between the accuracy of subject's mental models (as measured by the
mental model task diagrams) and their level of familiarity with
hypertext systems. Subjects who were familiar with hypertext systems
and presumably therefore with the way, in which, they can be
structured, produced better diagrams than those did with little
familiarity with hypertext systems. These subjects could also benefit
from their experience of, and familiarity with, the task of browsing
and searching in hypertext systems to learn and retrieve information.
The finding that subjects with experience of hypertext systems produce
better diagrams supports the notion that subjects unfamiliar with
hypertext systems may have found the drawing tasks harder.</p><p>An
alternative experimental procedure which could be adopted if it was
necessary to control for experience with hypertext systems, is to allow
subjects time to familiarise themselves with a range of hypertext
systems. However, in terms of design practice, it is important to take
into account the needs of users who have not previously used hypertext
systems.</p><p>A secondary aim of this research was to gather as much
empirical data on lostness as possible. A large volume of data was
collected during the course of the studies described above and some of
the most interesting and theoretically relevant findings are outlined
below.</p><p>The pre-study questionnaire provided invaluable data on
what people in general think are the causes of lostness. The main
finding from this questionnaire was that the subjects in the study
considered link semantics (ambiguous/poorly labelled links) to be more
important (45% of respondents) in causing lostness than problems
directly related to link structuring (too many links—27%, inability to
reverse—23%). Overall the 22 subjects who took part in this study named
26 possible causes of lostness which provides support for the idea that
lostness may not be a unitary concept with a unitary measure and a
unitary solution.</p><p>The post-study questionnaire responses provided
much useful data. In particular it was found that there were strong
correlations between self-reports of lostness and task times, system
learnability, ease of finding information, and helpfulness of the start
page. The helpfulness of the start page appeared to be another crucial
variable, correlating not only with self-reports of lostness but also
with system learnability and how frustrating the system was to use.</p><p>This
suggests that when designing systems and attempting to produce accurate
and unambiguous link labels, and careful link structuring, extra care
should be taken on the start or home page. It is perhaps at this point
that the potential to reduce lostness and increase scent is at its
greatest. The research of <a href="#bib31">Rosch et al. (1976)</a> on
the ‘basic level’ of representations of conceptual hierarchies in terms
of categorisations is of particular relevance at this point in the
discussion. Rosch's argument was that the role of the human
categorisation system is to reflect perceived world structure in a set
of categories, which provide maximum information with minimum effort
and that there was one level, the basic level, where this was
particularly pertinent. This principle she has called cognitive
economy. The basic level is assumed to be the most convenient for
cognitive activities such as memory, perception and learning. It is
assumed that there is a close relationship between the principle of
cognitive economy and the principle of cognitive overheads, described
by <a href="#bib8">Conklin (1987)</a> as the cognitive demands placed
on users of hypertext systems. If there is such a close relationship
then maximising cognitive economy at the start page should help to
reduce cognitive overheads and thereby increase scent and reduce
lostness.<a name="toc34"></a></p><h3 class="h3">8. General discussion and conclusion</h3><p>One
of the main findings from this study is that there is no one clear
measure of lostness. Although the link weighted measure of lostness
produced slightly better correlations than <a href="#bib1">Smith’s (1996)</a>
non-link weighted measure against other measures assumed to be
associated with lostness, it certainly did not explain all the variance
in the data. This could have been partly due to the relatively small
sample size, the types of tasks that were selected and the highly
predictable nature of the domain and hypertext system chosen. Although
it would be preferable to have used a larger sample size, the number
used (12) was certainly sufficient to provide a large set of valid
data. Care was also taken to use a set of representative tasks.
However, the results indicate that much of the variance in the data is
more likely to be due to the nature of lostness.</p><p>It is unlikely
that any single measure will ever capture all that it means to be lost.
If there is no single way of measuring lostness then it makes sense to
use a battery of measures which correlate well with one another and
which have been shown through empirical studies and in the literature
to measure lostness to some degree. This battery could then be used to
highlight areas in a system where problems lie and consequently, the
design could be improved. Thus metrics used independently, and as a
battery, can be used as a tool in the design of hypertext systems.<a name="toc35"></a></p><h4 class="h4">8.1. Predicting lostness</h4><p>One
important issue that needs to be discussed is whether the findings from
this research or the new measures that have been produced can be used
to predict which systems are more likely than others to make their
users lost. The answer to this is that they can.</p><p>As has been
mentioned throughout this discussion, the tentative results suggest
that different types of hyperlink induce lostness to different degrees,
and thus the measure could well be used to predict lostness. Hypertext
systems that are predominantly structured using associative links are,
because of the inherent unpredictability of the link destination, more
likely to cause lostness. The same applies to a lesser extent for
systems that predominantly use the other three types of hyperlink. This
comment still holds, even though the use of such links may be
unavoidable due to the way in which the information or the users’
tasks, are structured.</p><p>The link-weighted measure allows
predictions to be made, but not directly. It can be used to highlight
particular areas of existing designs that are causing users to become
lost. The problems in these particular areas could well be related to
poor design practices already well known in the HCI community, but the
use of this metric could uncover other aspects of poor design practice,
which are specifically related to lostness. If applied to a wide
variety of systems and users, it is likely that problematic aspects of
designs that cause lostness can be highlighted. New systems can then be
checked against a list of these problematic aspects of design in order
to predict which hypertext systems are most likely to cause lostness.</p><p>The
mental model metric could also be used indirectly to make predictions
about lostness, however the mental model tasks could have a much more
direct application for design. This is discussed in more detail in the
next section.<a name="toc36"></a></p><h4 class="h4">8.2. The mental model task as a new methodology for designing hypertext systems</h4><p>The
mental model tasks could be used as a new methodology for designing and
evaluating hypertext systems. This could be achieved by seeing if there
are mismatches in the designer's mental model of how the hypertext
document should be structured and how a sample of subjects models the
domain.</p><p>It could be used as part of an iterative design process
and perhaps could also be used when other usability measures have
discovered weaknesses in a design. In effect it would be another tool
in the HCI researchers toolbox when designing and evaluating hypertext
systems. The main advantage of the mental model drawing task method is
that it is quick and relatively easy to apply.</p><p>The research by <a href="#bib31">Rosch et al. (1976)</a>,
suggests that we as humans and users of hypertext systems, already have
an in-built conception of how information in domains should be
structured. Taxonomic links, by their very nature, connect one node of
information to many others, and consequently designers should take care
in assigning an appropriate link label. A new way in which designers
can be assisted in this particular task could be along the lines of the
mental model tasks in empirical Study 2, where the subjects were asked
to draw pathways through the system having never previously seen it.
This method could be applied prior to any design or implementation, as
a part of the requirements analysis.</p><p>If this new method were to
be applied it would allow the hypertext designer to have some idea of
the categorical structure that potential users of the system already
have of the domain. When asked, “Which bit of the system caused you to
be the most lost?” one subject in the main study commented that “the
link typology was awful”. Perhaps if this method had been employed
during the design of the Wye College web site then fewer subjects would
have shown signs of being lost.</p><p>The studies reported here suggest
that training would need to be given in the mental model tasks
themselves. One of the main differences between the mental model tasks
in the main study and the same task in the validation study, is the
cognitive demands of asking subjects to draw pathways through
structures which they had never seen. Training would be necessary in
order to reduce the effects of misunderstanding the nature of the
tasks. Training experienced hypertext users would not need to consist
of more than a couple of practice attempts. Those with low familiarity
could be “walked through” a couple of web sites. The mental model tasks
are not intrinsically more difficult than for instance, requesting
subjects to draw a map from their house to the shops via a particular
street.</p><p>The mental model tasks could be extended to investigate
how potential users mentally represent and categorise domains and the
knowledge within those domains. The extension would include a more
thorough study of these categorisations and domain knowledge, in order
to improve the design of hypertext structures. Users’ domain knowledge
could be gathered, analysed and modelled as Domain Knowledge Structures
(DKS): The DKSs would be closely related in structure to Task Knowledge
Structures (TKS: <a name="bbib39"></a>(<a href="#bib39">Johnson</a> and <a name="bbib40"></a><a href="#bib40">Johnson</a>)).
Specific tasks undertaken within domains would be represented as TKSs
within the appropriate DKS(s). The intention is that these DKSs would
inform designers of the domain knowledge users possess which guides
their expectations, inferencing and problem solving. These in turn will
partially dictate their interaction with, and navigation through, the
hypertext system. This new DKS approach could be applied not only to
hypertext systems but also to the labelling of menus, as an extension
to the recent work by <a href="#bib26">Richardson et al. (1997)</a>, and Larson and Czerwinski on scent following.</p><p>The
underlying philosophy of this mental models approach is that there will
be consistency and invariance in some of the guesses, expectations and
inferences generated by users, due to how they categorise domains and
the knowledge within domains. This knowledge, coupled with universal
aspects of cognition and information processing, should dictate aspects
of user behaviour when interacting with hypertext systems.
Consequently, this knowledge can be exploited by constructors of
hypertext systems. There will, of course, also be differences in domain
knowledge and expertise which will also play a part in their
interaction with the system. This approach ensures that the user is
still in control, and there is consistency in the hypertext system that
can be utilised by users in generating further expectations and
hypotheses.</p><p>An alternative approach to structuring hypertext has been proposed by <a name="bbib41"></a><a href="#bib41">Chen (1998)</a>.
Chen argues that closely related documents or nodes could be placed
near each other and only ntrinsic connections between then could be
shown to users as automatically generated “virtual” links. The
“relatedness” or similarity of documents and nodes could be based on
hyperlink usage, content similarity and usage patterns. The outcome
would be a “self-inorganised” information space which could be
tranformed based on, for instance, usage patterns. Consequently, the
structure of the information space is incrementally tailored to users’
search and browsing styles. A similar approach is proposed by <a name="bbib42"></a><a href="#bib42">Calvi and De Bra (1998)</a>
with respect to hypertext for learning. They consider that student
learning could be enhanced by hypertext courseware that automatically
modifies its’ link structure during the student's learning process. A
further suggestion is that there could be changes to information
content in addition to link availability.</p><p>Both Chen's and Calvi
&amp; De Bra's approaches are quite different to the approach we are
advocating. They are suggesting individual tailored systems which may
involve the use of AI techniques to adapt the hypertext system to
individual users, and that the hypertext structure is not static. There
have been CHI panel debates about the efficacy of the use of
intelligence at the interface with both proponents (e.g. Maes) and
antagonists (e.g. Shneiderman). It would be interesting to assess and
compare the outcomes of the two different approaches.<a name="toc37"></a></p><h4 class="h4">8.3. Future research</h4><p>This
research has opened up a number of avenues for future research. The
measures and approach employed here need to be applied, replicated and
refined with different systems and different user populations. If the
findings remain constant across these studies than it is probable that
these are factors, or combinations of factors, that result in lost
users.</p><p>There were two possible approaches to discovering whether or not the types of hyperlinks as specified by <a href="#bib19">De Rose (1989)</a>
affect lostness. This present research was one of the two. The
alternative would have been to investigate a number of different web
sites each with a predomination of one of the four main types. The
reason why this approach was rejected was due to the multitude of
uncontrollable and potentially confounding variables, such as site size
and differences in domain. It would be possible to create systems, but
creating them so that the only difference between them was the linking
structure would create an artificial structure for a hypertext system.
However, this approach could be used to test specific hypotheses about
lostness which might have arisen from the studies reported here. The
artificial nature of a specially created hypertext system would have to
be taken into account in any discussion as to the validity and
generality of the findings (<a href="#bib35">Gray and Salzman, 1998</a>)
and those findings would need to be corroborated by more naturalistic
studies, which also have both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>A
totally naturalistic study of lostness such as accumulating log data
from a ‘walk up and use’ hypertext system already in use, is one
option. Users themselves would be involved in choosing the information
tasks, which would allow them to direct their own acquisition of mental
models. After using the system, they could be asked what information
they were looking for, etc. However, it is important to note that log
data does not give adequate indications of how well-designed a system
might be unless user tasks and intentions are known.</p><p>As discussed
above, if the general approach to measuring mental models used in this
research, is to be developed for system design purposes, or as a means
of assessing usability, then much more research needs to be conducted.
In particular the following issues need to be considered: What exactly
is being measured, how the measure can be improved, how it can best be
applied, what problems do people encounter when performing these tasks,
why and at which point was this the case? It might be interesting to
look at the effects of link type on the mental model tasks too. Did
subjects have particular problems drawing the diagrams and if so at
what points? Do these points correlate with different types of
hyperlink? These are research issues we are currently investigating.</p><p>If
the poor design of hypertext systems does have an influence on
lostness, it would be interesting to look at lostness in relation to
other poor design practice by comparing data on lostness to other
usability measures, such as inconsistency. In the hypertext system used
in this study there were a number of inconsistencies in the overall
design. Certain departments had simply added information on their
department to the main body of the Wye college web site, but done it so
that the overall ‘look and feel’ was inconsistent. Perhaps it was in
these areas where the subjects were most lost. This is an important
area for future investigation. </p></div><br><div class="art">
