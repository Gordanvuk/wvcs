<h2> Additional material for the lectures
</h2>
<h3>
Extra material on Gantt and PERT charts:
</h3>
<p>

The wikipedia entries on Gantt and PERT charts are a reasonable place to start:
<br>
<a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt"> Wikipedia Gannt chart entry </a>
<br>

<a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique"> Wikipedia PERT chart entry </a>
<br>
<br>

Also an external link from the wikipedia Gantt entry goes to a useful looking document, but it is about using Open Office:

<a href ="http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/spreadsheet/gantt_pm.pdf"> Project Management with Gantt charts </a>
<br>
<br>
Example Gannt chart from a recent project we were planning, <a href="multi2sim-gantt.pdf"> the Multi2Sim Project. </a>
<br>
<br>
Material on useful books in the library on Gantt and PERT charts will appear here very soon!


<h3>
Online guides to Harvard referencing: </h3>
<a href = "http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/training/referencing/harvard.htm"> Leeds University </a>
<p>
<a href = "http://library.curtin.edu.au/referencing/harvard.pdf"> Curtin University </a>
<br> This is a pdf, so easier to download if you wish.
<p>
<h3>
Additional material on literature reviews </h3>
<br>
The articles I used for the literature review on measures of lostness on websites:
<br>
<a href= "gwizdka&spence.htm"> Gwizdka and Spence (2007) </a>
<br>
<a href= "ahuja&webster.htm"> Ahuja and Webster (2001) </a>
<br>
<a href= "otter&johnson.htm"> Otter and Johnson (2000) </a>
<br>
<a href= "smith.htm"> Smith (1996) </a>
<br>

<h3> Additional material on writing style </h3>
To test the "readability" of your text, you can use various indices of readability (do take these with a big pinch of salt, they are limited in 
their usefulness, but can help you monitor for sentence length/complexity and word length):
<a href=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/SMOG.htm> here's one on the web </a>, I haven't tried it myself.  I will do so in the next few days and post any comments I have.

<h3> Researching literature </h3>
In the lecture I mentioned using the <a href=http://www.acm.org/dl">ACM Digital Library </a> and the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/dynhome.jsp"> IEEE Explore Library </a>. You can get full access to articles in the ACM Digital Library, at least if you log in
from departmental machines (I'm not sure what happens beyond the department).  Unfortunately, for the IEEE we only appear to have a licence which gives us access to abstracts of most papers.  For full content, you may need to order items through Inter-Library loan at the Library, or find out whether your supervisor is a member of IEEE (I'm not, so I'm afraid I can't help).

<br>

<h2 id = "Presentations">Presentations (for everyone)  </h2>
    

<p>All students will make a 5 minute presentation on their literature review.
<br>
PR3 students made their presentations in Week 5 of Autumn Term.

<p>
MEng and MSc NC students will do their presentations in Week 4 of Spring Term.  Fiona Polack is organizing these presentation, please direct any queries about them to her.

<p>

<h2 id = "Open_Assessment"> Open assessment (MEng and MSc NC students only) </h2>
