<h2>Presentation and Grammar Points (from assessment feedback)</h2>

<h3>Citation</h3>  

Here are some common problems with citation use.

<ul> 

<li>
Introductions were, generally, too light on citation.  Some people
only cited direct quotations, and most gave facts about the topic or
aspect of review without supporting citation.  Many people were
leaving themselves open to plagiarism accusation for unreferenced use
of ideas and facts that are not common knowledge.  

<ul> 

<li> Cite more than you think you need.

<li> Use general sources such as lecture notes and text books to back
up general points.

<li> Don't assume common knowledge if you can find a citation to back
it up.

</ul> 

<li>
Although most people who used longer direct quotation, inset from the
main text, correctly put an appropriate citation after each
quotation, some either omitted the citation or did not put it in the
right place.  This again leaves you open to plagiarism accusation, and
you would not have any defence.

</ul>

General advice is to cite early and often, and a lot more than you
think is needed.  For inspiration, look at project reports (such as
those cited in CSW) and published papers, but remember that not all of
these use citation in a way that would be considered adequate here.



<h3> General writing and grammar </h3>

Some people have problems expressing themselves clearly and
concisely.  Here are some <b>general writing and grammar tips</b> from one
who'e been doing it for years.

<ul>

<li> Always reread what you write, with a view to removing everything
that does not contribute.   I can usually reduce my first draft by
20%, and improve the clarity of what is said in the process.  Some of
the feedback that you received had been reduced to half its original
length by judicious pruning.

<li> If your grammar lets you down, do something about it!  There are
good books on grammar and punctuation.  There are well-written papers
and reports that you can read.  I recommended a number of well-written
projects in CSW.  Even when you've been told something is
well-written, look at how it could be improved.

<li> Use hyphens and apostrophes to clarify your meaning.

<ul>

<li> Where a string of descriptive words occurs, it is useful to
hyphenate the most-connected elements.  For example (with implicit
reference to the person who wrote this!), consider, "basic
  code block memory access instructions".  This could be "basic-code
  block memory-access instructions", or "basic code-block
  memory-access instructions" (or several other parses).  The problem
  is even worse when there is a word that could be a noun, adjective
  or verb in the string.
 </ul>
<li> Learn and apply the basic apostrophe rules:
<ul>


<li> Test for possessive nouns: if you can write a phrase in the form
"the X of Y", then the short form is, "the Y's X".  If the full form
would be "the X of Ys", then the short form is, "the Ys' X".
Irregular plurals retain the normal plural and apply the relevant
apostrophisation: men's room; people's palace; classes' timetabling.

<li> Never apostrophise a possessive pronoun: mine, yours, its, his,
hers, ours, theirs.  If you could use "mine" or "his" (which you can't
apostrophise) in a phrase, then you are using a possessive pronoun.
If you do not recognise possessive pronouns, use a variant of the
long-form test, above: would it be possible to write the phrase as
"the X of me, you, it, him, her, us or them"?  In which case the X is
mine, yours, its, his, hers, ours or theirs, as appropriate.

<li> Don't use short forms of verbs (like "Don't" for "Do not"!), and
particularly avoid "it's" for "it is".  This removes any possibility
of needing a real apostrophised "it's".  So, you should never need to
write "It's its leg" (as in "it is the leg of it").

<li> If you are really keen, learn about gerunds. "Its being Monday,
the weather was fine"; "the day's being Monday, the weather was
fine".  If you see a strange apostrophe in competent text, it is
likely to be one of these.  Don't expect a coherent explanation from
me of this obscure corner of English grammar.

</ul>

<li> Watch referential pronouns (this, they, them, it).  If you write a
series of clauses or sentences, it is tempting to make <i>them</i> refer back
to each other with pronouns. <i>This</i> can be confusing, as the
reader does not know to what <i>they</i> refer back.  When the text
had moved on a lot, <i>this</i> gets increasingly problematic.  At
least one CS journal requires its contributers to replace every
referential pronoun with the noun to which it refers (or to rephrase
more directly, which is usually a better solution): It is tempting to
make a clause or sentence refer back to an earlier concept.  Back
references become increasingly confusing as the distance from the concept
increases.  

<li> Watch noun-verb agreement.  Singular nouns, such as government,
paper, [Smith05], all take singular verbs.  "[Fred et al 05]
states..", even though the paper has multiple authors.  In this
context, try (it is not always possible) not to use
"they" as a surrogate for "he" or "she", but equally, don't use
"he/she" and "his/hers".

<li> Watch for classic ambiguities, such as "the author" - you, or the
person whose work you are reviewing?  Rephrase (here, using I if
necessary) to remove ambiguity.

<li> Write in the present tense.  The rest of your paper is all there
when I read it; the papers you review all exist, even if they report
old work.
