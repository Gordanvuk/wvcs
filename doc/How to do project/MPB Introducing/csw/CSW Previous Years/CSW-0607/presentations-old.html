and Third-Year Project (<A

<h1> Presentations </h1>      

Each student will make a 5 minute presentation, using a set of PowerPoint (or other application) slides.  
They may also give the audience any material on paper they think would be useful for the audience to look at during the presentation 
(this is unlikely, but if you have a table or something that is too detailed to present as a slide).
<p>

The audience will be Helen Petrie, a PhD student and the five other students in the group.  So if you have going to provide a handout, 
you will need to bring 7 copies of it.
<p>

Students will be expected to stay for the full hour of their presentation slot and may ask questions of other students' presentations.

<p>
Students doing PR3 will make their presentation on their project literature review.  
All other students (MEng and MSc NC) will make their presentation on the open assessment literature review that they are conducted.
<p>
Students should email their PowerPoint (or other application) slides to Helen Petrie 
<a href="mailto:helen.petrie@cs.york.ac.uk"> helen.petrie@cs.york.ac.uk</a>
at least 24 hours before their presentation slot, so we can be sure that they will run.

<p>
The presentation should review one, or at most two, key papers from your literature review.  It should cover:
<ul>
<li>
topic of the paper/s - this can be your title slide
<li>
author/s and title of the paper/s
brief description of what the paper/s are about, focussing on the part/s you are most interested in
<li>
some critique of the paper/s - can be positive or negative, what is most interesting/wrong etc with the paper/s 
(this is the meat of the presentation, so might be two slides
<li>
conclusion
</ul>
<p>

Note that this structure suggests 4 or 5 slides.  Remember that I suggested that you should not aim for much more than 1 slide per minute, so for a 5 minute talk, this is about all you need.
