<h2>Announcements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>27/2/09: <b>Cohort feedback</b>: Some general remarks about the 
	performance of the whole cohort can be found
	<a href="assessment/cohort-feedback-0809.html">here</a>. In general, I'm 
	more than willing to discuss the individual feedback I've given. I may no 
	longer have easy access to the scripts, though I do have my own notes, but I 
	should be able to clarify any remarks I've made. Please drop me an email 
	(but read the general feedback first!).</li>
	<li>27/2/09: As part of last week's YUSU-led <b>Academic Integrity Week</b>, 
	a local <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/k-roy/integrity/ac%20integrity.htm">
	website</a> has been produced which contains much useful information on 
	referencing, academic writing, and so on. Included in the site are 
	particularly useful links to external resources on academic writing: look 
	under Hints &amp; Tips.</li>
	<li>13/2/09: <b>Presentation marking</b>: I've been asked for some 
	clarifications: please see comments <a href="pres-marking.txt">here</a>.</li>
	<li>12/2/09: <b>Presentation marks and feedback</b>: you should have 
	received an email from Pauline, explaining that both peer comments and 
	'official' marks and comments are available from her. Please note (for 
	reasons of equity) that I will not be giving any cohort-level feedback until 
	the final two presentations have been given at the end of week 6. Also note 
	that (for boring technical reasons to do with the Exams database) 
	presentation marks will not be available online, only the combined mark for 
	presentation and report (when I have finished the report marking!).</li>
	<li>26/1/09: <b>Presentations</b> (MEng/MMath and MScNC): see detailed 
	instructions <a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/assessment/">here</a> 
	. In particular, please note the requirement to <b>email your slides</b> at 
	least 24 hours before your presentation.</li>
	<li>26/1/09: <b>Lit review handin</b>: briefly: you need to hand in a printed 
	version of your Lit review to the Office <b>and</b> an online version, via 
	the electronic submission mechanism
	<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/submit/openassess.html">here</a>. Deadline 
	for both is Wednesday week 3, at noon. Further details
	<a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/assessment/">here</a>.</li>
	<li>21/11/08: <b>Feedback on presentations</b> (for PR3 students) is now 
	available outside the Dept Office: the yellow folder contains 4 wallets, one 
	for each session of presentations. This feedback will remain available until 
	the end of week 8 and will then be removed.</li>
	<li>7/11/08: Contrary to what I said at lecture this morning, the <b>Open 
	Assessment</b> (for MEng/MMath/MScNC) will not be available until Wednesday 
	of week 5 (12 November). It will then be available from the Departmental 
	Office.</li>
	<li>4/11/08: Details of <b>week 5 presentations</b> are now given
	<a href="#Presentations">below</a>. All PR3 students (ie BEng/BSc) are 
	expected to give one of these presentations.</li>
	<li>28/10/08: I'm sorry to say that <b> Susan Stepney has lost her voice, so cannot give Wednesday's 10.15 lecture</b> (on Stats and Graphs). This will be rescheduled later, probably next week.
    I will still be giving the  12.15 lecture (Presentations and referencing).</li>

<h2> Additional material for the lectures
</h2>
<h3>
Extra material on Gantt and PERT charts:
</h3>
<p>

The wikipedia entries on Gantt and PERT charts are a reasonable place to start:
<br>
<a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt"> Wikipedia Gannt chart entry </a>
<br>

<a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique"> Wikipedia PERT chart entry </a>
<br>
<br>

Also an external link from the wikipedia Gantt entry goes to a useful looking document, but it is about using Open Office:

<a href ="http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/spreadsheet/gantt_pm.pdf"> Project Management with Gantt charts </a>
<br>
<br>
Example Gannt chart from a recent project we were planning, <a href="multi2sim-gantt.pdf"> the Multi2Sim Project. </a>
<br>
<br>
Material on useful books in the library on Gantt and PERT charts will appear here very soon!


<h3>
Online guides to Harvard referencing: </h3>
<a href = "http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/training/referencing/harvard.htm"> Leeds University </a>
<p>
<a href = "http://library.curtin.edu.au/referencing/harvard.pdf"> Curtin University </a>
<br> This is a pdf, so easier to download if you wish.
<p>
<h3>
Additional material on literature reviews </h3>
<p>
to follow</p>

<h3> Additional material on writing style </h3>
To test the "readability" of your text, you can use various indices of readability (do take these with a big pinch of salt, they are limited in 
their usefulness, but can help you monitor for sentence length/complexity and word length):
<a href=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/SMOG.htm> here's one on the web </a>, 
There are several online tools available; see for instance
<a href="http://www.editcentral.com/">here</a>.<h3> Researching literature </h3>
In the lecture I mentioned using the <a href=http://www.acm.org/dl">ACM Digital Library </a> and the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/dynhome.jsp"> IEEE Explore Library </a>. You can get full access to articles in the ACM Digital Library, at least if you log in
from departmental machines (I'm not sure what happens beyond the department).  Unfortunately, for the IEEE we only appear to have a licence which gives us access to abstracts of most papers.  For full content, you may need to order items through Inter-Library loan at the Library, or find out whether your supervisor is a member of IEEE (I'm not, so I'm afraid I can't help).
