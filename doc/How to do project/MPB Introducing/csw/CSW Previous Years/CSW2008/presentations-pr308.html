Presentations </h1>
<p>All students taking PR3 will make an unassessed presentation in Autumn week 
5. MEng/MMath students and MScNC students will do assessed presentations in the 
spring term. The remainder of this page applies to PR3 students: details for 
next term's presentations will be given later.</p>
<h4>PR3 student presentations</h4>
<p>The timetable for presentations is given
<a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/pres-aut5.pdf">here</a>. Note that 
the Monday morning slot starts at 10:00am, and lasts until 11.15. The other 
slots each last for 2 hours: please be prompt as the timing is very tight. If 
you have problems with the timetable, please find a student in another session 
to swap with, and let me know by email of the changes. Note also that the groups 
are slightly different from those advertised at the start of term on the 
Timetables page.</p>Each student will make a 5 minute presentation, using a set of PowerPoint (or other application) slides.  
They may also give the audience any material on paper they think would be useful for the audience to look at during the presentation 
(this is unlikely, but if you have a table or something that is too detailed to present as a slide).
<p>

The audience will be Steve King, a PhD student (demonstrator) and the other students in the group.  So if you have 
decided to provide a handout, 
you will need to bring up to 16 copies of it.
<p>

Students will be expected to stay for the full session of their presentation slot and may ask questions of other students' presentations. 
This session will be either one or two hours long. Students are also welcome to 
attend presentation sessions when they are not presenting themselves, except for 
the session on Friday in G/001, which is only large enough for the timetabled 
group.<p>
Students doing PR3 will make their presentation on their project literature review.  
(All other students (MEng/MMath and MSc NC) will later make their presentation on the open assessment literature review that they 
have conducted.)
<p>
Students should email their PowerPoint (or other application) slides to Steve 
King <a href="mailto:king@cs.york.ac.uk">king@cs.york.ac.uk</a>
at least 24 hours before their presentation slot, so we can be sure that they will run.

The email should also state which session the slides are for.<p>
The presentation should review one, or at most two, key papers from your literature review.  It should cover:
<ul>
<li>
topic of the paper/s - this can be your title slide
<li>
author/s and title of the paper/s
brief description of what the paper/s are about, focussing on the part/s you are most interested in
<li>
some critique of the paper/s - can be positive or negative, what is most interesting/wrong etc with the paper/s 
(this is the meat of the presentation, so might be two slides
<li>
conclusion
</ul>
<p>

Note that this structure suggests 4 or 5 slides.  Remember that I suggested that you should not aim for much more than 1 slide per minute, so for a 5 minute talk, this is about all you need.

<p>

Feedback: all students giving presentations will receive written feedback 
afterwards. For PR3 students, it is likely to be week 6 before it can be 
collated and distributed.<p>
