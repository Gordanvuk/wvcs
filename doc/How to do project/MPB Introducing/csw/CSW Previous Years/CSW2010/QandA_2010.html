  <li> <em> 
    <div> When choosing a subject area, the assesment guidelines say I should 
      select from research groups of the department. Does this mean that I cant 
      review papers that isnt researched at York, for example on malware detection?</div>
    </em></li>
</ul>
<p>You are not restricted to publications by York people. The restriction on subject 
  area is not intended to be very strict, but I do want to prevent people doing 
  a lit review on 'What I did in my summer holidays' or some other esoteric subject 
  unrelated to CS. The restriction to 'York research group subject areas' is simply 
  meant to be an easy way to define 'sensible bits of Computer Science'.<br>
