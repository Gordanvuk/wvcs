Presentations </h1>
<p>All students taking PR3/PR4 will make an unassessed presentation in Autumn 
  week 5. 3rd year MEng students and MScNC students will do assessed presentations 
  in the spring term. The remainder of this page applies to PR3/PR4 students: 
  details for next term's presentations will be given later.</p>
<h2>PR3/PR4 student presentations</h2>
<p>The timetabled slots and the group allocation for the presentations are given 
  on the CSW webpage <a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/index.html#Presentations">here</a>. 
  If you have problems with the timetable, please find a student in another session 
  to swap with, and let me know by email of the changes by Friday 5th (6.00 pm).</p>
<p>Each student will make a 5 minute presentation, using a set of PowerPoint (or 
  other application) slides. They may also give the audience any material on paper 
  they think would be useful for the audience to look at during the presentation 
  (this is unlikely, but if you have a table or something that is too detailed 
  to present as a slide).</p>
<p> The audience will be Stefano Pirandola, two demonstrators (James McLaughlin, 
  Ahmad Shahid) and the other students in the group. 
<p> Students will be expected to stay for the full session of their presentation 
  slot and may ask questions of other students' presentations. Students are also 
  welcome to attend presentation sessions when they are not presenting themselves.
<p> Students doing PR3/PR4 will make their presentation on their project literature 
  review. All the other students (MEng and MSc NC) will later make their presentation 
  on the open assessment literature review that they have conducted.
<p> Students should email their PowerPoint (or other application) slides to Stefano 
  Pirandola <a href="mailto:pirs@cs.york.ac.uk"> pirs@cs.york.ac.uk</a> at least 
  24 hours before their presentation slot, so we can be sure that they will run. 
  The email should also state which session the slides are for.
<h2>Presentation Plan and Timings</h2>
<p> The presentation should review one key paper (or at most two) from your literature 
  review. The presentation itself should have the following four elements: 
<ol>
  <li> Paper details: author, title, publication details 
  <li> Context: a brief statement of the area of computer science, and general 
    background to the paper 
  <li> Content: what the paper covers 
  <li> Critical evaluation: merits and demerits of the paper, concluding comments
</ol>
<p> Content review should outline the underlying theme(s) of the paper, and perhaps 
  illustrate a small example of what is covered.
<p>Evaluation should contain critiques of the paper - can be positive or negative, 
  what is most interesting/wrong etc with the paper. Is it advanced/trivial; easy 
  read/unnecessarily complex etc....who should use the paper, and for what. Is 
  the paper useful for further advances in the field?
<p> As a rough guide, the paper details can be displayed; the context should take 
  a minute at most; the content should take about 2 minutes, and the evaluation 
  about 2 minutes.
<p> Note that this structure suggests 4 or 5 slides. Remember that I suggested 
  that you should not aim for much more than 1 slide per minute, so for a 5 minute 
  talk, this is about all you need.
<h2>Presentation Feedback</h2>
<p> The presentation is not formally assessed, but completed <A
  href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/presentation/PR3%20-%20Presentation%20-%20Marking.pdf">feedback 
  sheets</A> will be returned to students. 
<p> 
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p> PR3/PR4 students will receive written feedback (the form is linked, above), 
  but it won't be available until late week 6, before it can be collated and distributed
