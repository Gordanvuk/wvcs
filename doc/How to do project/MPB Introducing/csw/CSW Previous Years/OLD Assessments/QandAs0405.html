I've managed to end up with an appendix to my literature review - is this
acceptable, or should I try to remove it?  It contains a list of examples
that are part of my introduction.  They would clutter up the review if I
included them there, so I thought an appendix was the best place to put
them.

</p>
</em>
<p>
It is sensible, in any academic writing, to use an appendix for distracting but
useful examples.  I had not considered the possibility that students
might like to use appendices; my main concern is that the appendices
not be used to try to circumvent the strict length and layout limits.
<p>
So, I have decided that you <i>may</i> include appendices, after the
Bibliography.  I will <i>not</i> mark the material in the
appendices.  I will not make deductions for exceeding the page etc limits,
so long as the surplus pages comprise solely material in the appendices.
If particularly well-used, or particularly badly-used, appendices may
influence a tiny part of the overall presentation marking.

When referring to the work done by someone may we refer to them simply
by name or must we provide a citation, for example:

The approach taken by Blah involved X, from this [Blah05] found Y and
Z.

or,

The approach taken by [Blah05] involved X, from this [Blah05] found Y
and Z.

(n.b. where 'Y and Z' is some paraphrased text)

To me the second case doesn't read as nicely and can be confusing when
citing paraphrased text in the same sentence. The first case though
less precise sounds better, but could potentially be ambiguous. What
are the regulations regarding this?

</p>
</em>
<p>
The first comment is, whatever you decide to do, do it consistently.
This is the most important thing for readability.
<p>
There is no fixed formula for putting the citations in to sentences
like this.  It is good to get the reference in on the first mention.  I guess I would do something like,
<p>
"The approach taken by [Blah05] involved X; this led to the conclusions Y
and Z [Blah05]."
<p>
This avoids the distraction of the immediate second citation, but
makes it clear that Y and Z, as well as X, come from that specific source.
</p>

<p>
If one of our chosen resources is a book that is a
collection of published papers (think LNCS and alike) should we cite
the book, or (more precisely) the article to which the citation
relates. In the later case if we cite from multiple articles in the
same book does this count as more than one resource?

</p>
</em>
<p>
There are several sorts of "collections".  The commonest (most LNCS)
are conference papers: I gave you a citation format (suggestion) in
the slides.  Obviously, in this case, each paper is a separate
contribution to knowledge, independent of the others, and is a
separate source.
<p>
You might come across themed books, where the papers (usually invited)
are closely related - ie much more so than simply being presented at
the same conference.  There are some of these in the LNCS series.  The
book is usually clearly divided into chapters (unlike conference
proceedings, where the papers are separate components of the book);
each chapter has the author(s) noted, and the book has an overall
editor.  Typically, such books start with an explanatory chapter of
how the collection came to be assembled - perhaps as a tribute to some
famous person, or as the outcome of a working-party on a particular
theme.  If the book is clearly one dependent set of papers, you might
get away with it as one source, but please clearly cite which chapter
each "fact" comes from, using authors' names if appropriate.  For
example, if there were a collection of writings from a working party
on Database Transaction Committal, editted by S. Smith, 1996, you
might have something like,
<p>
"The committal process was subject of a working party in 1995 [Smi96];
consensus was that X, although Bloggs states the important reservation
that Y [Smi96, chapter 8]."

In this latter case, the bibliographic entry would be just for Smi96.

<p>
 I'm using this quotation from a cited source [editted]: 
<p>
"Previous work has focused on [aspect X] (e.g., Bruno &
Lassagne (1975), Couch & Hamm (1977), Miller (1987))
and [aspect Y] (e.g., Hayes
(1986), Hand (1989))."
<p>
  Do I need to include full bibliographic entries for
each of the sources cited in the quotation too,
bearing in mind I'm not actually going to read any of
them?

</p>
</em>
<p>
In general, you would include the sources for these, but you might
make it clear that these are not "your" references.  The simple reason
is that a citation in a quotation without the accompanying reference
is irritating and incomplete.  So, you need a solution that makes the
text look and read sensibly, so that a reader gets something useful
from it.
<p>
I can think immediately of two ways of doing the bibliographic
references:
<ol>
<li> under the original source reference, list the subsidiary
references, indented, with a note saying that they were cited in the
original and quoted in your text; OR
<li> include each citation in the bibliography as if it were "yours",
but add a note to each stating "cited in Fred (2004)" to indicate that
it is not used independently.
</ol>
<p>
A variant of these alternatives would be to give a second bibliographic
listing of "secondary sources", with the entries annotated to indicate
that they are cited in quotation from a "primary" source.
<p>
One thing to avoid, because it's silly and misleading, is leaving the
original quoted citations in their original form with no elaboration.
I recall one particularly horrid project (not in this department!)
which used the [1], [2] etc style of citation, and had a quotation
containing [9].  [9] in the bibliography was totally unrelated to the
quoted text, being the [9] in the report bibliography, not the [9] from
the quoted paper!
<p>
A radical alternative would be to abandon the quotation, and say
something like, "....demonstrating the relative lack of literature in this
area, Fred (2004) cites only three existing works on X and two on Y".
<p>
It's up to you which feels best in your report.

For the review section of the assessment, do we need to review purely the
content covered in the papers, or cover both the content and the
presentation/structure of the papers? Whilst it is clearly stated in both
the assessment paper and additional information that the content of the
sources should be covered, in the additional information, you say "...it
needs to present a critique of the sources, in the context of the chosen
aspect". This seems ambiguous as to whether the critique is of the content
of the paper only or also the structure

</p>
</em>
<p>
I'm afraid I don't see any ambiguity here.  Review is about reviewing
the content.  A review always has a context - here the chosen aspect
of the chosen topic.  I have been very careful to use
terminology consistently throughout the assessment, and I'm pretty
sure that there is no direct or indirect reference to any need to
review the structure and presentation of the papers that you read.
<p>
If the presentation were relevant (for instance, if there were no
results, or no comparison to other work etc), that would be worth
noting in the review, but the absence of sections is essentially part
of the review of content anyway.
<p>
It may help to think of the CSW assessment as a (reduced and
constrained) trial run for the project literature review, to get the
idea of critical review and constructing an argument from literature
in a context.  The project, and the assessment, are situated within a
general topic (as per the headings used on the provided publications
list).  However, both are about a specific aspect of this topic, which
must be motivated, explained, justified, elaborated (etc) through a
review of literature related (directly or indirectly) to that aspect.
<p>
I hope that it is obvious that talking about the way a paper is
written is unlikely to be relevant to the project literature review;
equally it is unlikely to be relevant here.

Please could you clarify what is meant by the following sentence in section 7 of the Further Information on the assessment:
<p>

"You should cite these specific sources if required in the conclusion section of the assessment, but should not use the specific or general sources as part of the commentary provided in the review - that is, in the conclusion, the sources should only be used as citations of facts."
<p>

I do not remember your defining in the lectures exactly what the commentary of a review is, but I would see it as being the critique of the specific sources. I don't see how we can write this without citing the specific sources. 
</p>
</em>
<p>
The quotation comes from the bottom of p5 of Further Information,
which is outlining how the sources should be used in the substance of
the report.
The phrasing is unnecessarily obscure - apologies.  
<p>
"commentary" refers back to the first paragraph of section 6, where it
relates to proposal or "further work" ideas presented in the
conclusion.  
<br> 
"Review" is intended to refer to the whole
assessment report; it would have been clearer to say "conclusion" in
this context!
<p>
Essentially, if you think of the assessment as three sections of text
(and various other odds and ends), then, <ul> <li> sources used in the
intro are general (only), to introduce the topic to a CS audience;
<li> sources used in the review are the (at most four) specific
sources, (with some further use of the general sources from the intro
if necessary); <li> if it is necessary to cite in the conclusion,
there should be no new sources, and the citations should only be in
relation to "facts" from the previous sources that are required in the
(concluding) commentary.  For example, if your conclusion commented on
some "further research", then you might wish to indicate how this
extended the work (or further work) outlined in one of the specific
sources, or you might wish to comment on how it would build on aspects
of the research
presented in several of the previous sources, etc.  </ul>
</p>
</ul>
What I wish to achieve by this is that, even when commenting on
possible "follow ons", a conclusion is for concluding, not for
presenting new discussion.
<p>
Get back to me if this is still obscure!
