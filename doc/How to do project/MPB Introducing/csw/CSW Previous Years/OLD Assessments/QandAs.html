<h1>Spr/2/tue</h1>
<ul>
	<li><i>In the area of software test, I found two papers that related to 
	mutation test. The one I found in HISE group has&nbsp;basically introduced 
	mutation testing for OO programs,&nbsp;while another found in NSC group is&nbsp;how to 
	evolve mutation testing by Artificial Immune System. Then I am going to find 
	some ideas that associate natural algorithm with software safety or 
	security. Could you please advice me whether this topic&nbsp;meet the 
	requirements of CSW assessment?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Mutation Testing is clearly an area of interest to the groups mentioned, so 
this sounds fine.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>I'm still unsure exactly what is meant by &quot;</i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(35, 31, 32); font-style: italic;">You 
	should select from the subject areas of the research groups, and the members 
	of staff in the research groups, of the Department.</span></span><i>&quot;. If I 
	chose to do something related to the Computer Vision research group, then 
	their research areas include pattern recognition and image processing, 
	amongst others. Does this mean that it would be alright to do anything 
	within the field of image processing, for example something to do with 
	Optical Character Recognition (OCR)? This does not seem to be a particular 
	research interest of anyone in the Computer Vision research group, and there 
	are no publications on this topic by anyone in the group as far as I know. 
	However, this still seems to be covered by the subject areas of the research 
	group.<br>
	<br>
	I suppose I am just asking whether we are limited to a subject which has 
	been explicitly explored by someone within the research groups (and 
	publications on that specific subject exist within the department), or just 
	the general subject areas of the research groups?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>First: you are not restricted to publications by York people. (That would be 
very boring!) Second, the restriction on subject area is not intended to be very 
strict, but I do want to prevent people doing a lit review on 'What I did in my 
summer holidays' or some other esoteric subject unrelated to CS. The restriction 
to 'York research group subject areas' is simply meant to be an easy way to 
define 'sensible bits of Computer Science'. For your particular example, OCR 
seems a perfectly reasonable topic, even if no-one in CVPR group has explicitly 
published on it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p wrap><i>I know there have been several questions already on this area, 
	but I am<br>
	still slightly unsure.<br>
	I was thinking of doing my report based on the use of evolutionary<br>
	algorithms in robotics.&nbsp; This would come under the research area<br>
	&quot;Reality-Based Computation&quot; but there are no specific projects/papers I<br>
	can see from the group covering this particular topic.&nbsp; So would this 
	be a<br>
	valid topic or does the topic have to be something that has specifically<br>
	been covered by the research group?</i></li>
</ul>
<p wrap>See answer above. Your suggested topic sounds fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Spr/2/mon</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
	<pre wrap><i>Is it possible to submit a draft copy of the lit review for you to have a
look over and provide some general feedback about what is good/bad etc?

I understand if you don't want to commit to this but it would be handy to
know if I'm comparing the two papers enough and not just repeating what
they say. It all gets a bit fuzzy after you spend a lot of time reading
and writing about the same subject.</i></pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm afraid not. Firstly, if I did this for one student, I'd have to do it for 
all, and I simply don't have time for that. Secondly, commenting on drafts like 
this opens up all sorts of questions as far as parity of assessment is 
concerned: if one student's draft is pretty good and they don't need much 
assistance, while another's is not so good and they benefit greatly from the 
initial feedback, but the two assessments end up at the same level, is that 
fair? How can the achievement of the students and the assistance offered be 
factored into the mark awarded? We very seldom get involved in this sort of 
commenting on drafts for this reason. (Project reports themselves are an 
honourable exception!)</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<pre wrap><i>the assignment stated we should hand in no more than 6 A4 pages. Do the
cover page and the bibliography page count one of six?</i></pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessment (section 3.2) is pretty clear that the bibliography is 
included in the page count: &quot;<font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#231f20">no 
more than 6 A4 pages, of which one A4 page shall comprise only the 
bibliography.&quot;. If you feel the need to add a cover page, I suppose I would 
probably be generous and not regard that as part of the page count.</p></font>
<h1>Spr/1/mon</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
	<blockquote type="cite">
<em>
		do we have to choose the literature written by the staff or the member 
		of 
		the research group of York? </em></blockquote>
	</li>
</ul>
No. It is the subject area that needs to be related to York research (see 
section 1.1 of the assessment paper). The choice of papers can be from anywhere 
(see section 1.2). 

<h1>Spr/0/sat</h1>
<em>
<ul>
	<li>
	<pre wrap>I would like to choose 'comparison of concurrent programming languages' as
my review subject area. However, there is no publication on such topic in
any research group of York. I'm wondering if this meet the requirements of
the CSW assessment?
</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
</em>The assessment paper is quite clear on this point:<font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#231f20"><blockquote>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>You should select from the subject areas of the research 
	groups, and the members of staff in the research groups, of the Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	[p2]</i></p>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
Thus, if you cannot find anything about concurrent programming languages among 
the work of the department's research groups, it does not meet the criteria. 
[But I'd be surprised, particularly if there's nothing in the PLASMA group's 
work.]. Sorry.<em><ul>
	<li>
	<pre wrap>Is use of a 2-column format allowable or preferred, or should I stick
to the standard single-column article format?</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
</em>The assessment paper is not so clear on this! There are no stated 
restrictions on the page layout to be used, so a 2-column format would be 
acceptable. However, please note that there are wordcount restrictions, as well 
as page count restrictions: if you want to use 2-column format to 'squeeze in' 
more material, make sure that the wordcount limits are not exceeded.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Aut/11/wed</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
<blockquote type="cite">
	I'm writing to ask if the choice of the &quot;subject area&quot; as defined in CSW <br>
	assignment sheet is correct. On the following web page: <br>
	<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/arch/publications/Listing/@@phd">
	http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/arch/publications/Listing/@@phd</a> which belongs 
	to <br>
	Advanced Computer Architecture Group I found two publications on Financial
	<br>
	Forecasting. I want to write review on it. More precisely I want to state
	<br>
	whether financial forecasting is possible using any mathematical model. As
	<br>
	a result, I'm planning to criticize random walk model. Could you please <br>
	advice me, whether this topic meets constraints of the CSW assignment ? <br>
&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>
</em>The area is fine, but I'm worried that you seem to be saying that you will 
read and review 2 PhD theses: that's quite a lot of work! If you could find 
shorter papers by the authors of those theses, that would be a better starting 
point <br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h1>Aut/10/tue</h1>
<em>
<ul>
	<li>
	<pre>Because I have no prior knowledge of what the review topic is, I'm finding
myself quoting lots of sentences from the chosen documents.

What I'm wanting to know is... if you state two sentences from the same
document (maybe from difference parts), in one paragraph - do you need to
add a citation at the end of every sentence or at the end of the whole
thing.

e.g.
Cars have four wheels [1]. Cars have a steering wheel [1].
OR
Cars have four wheels. Cars have a steering wheel [1].
</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
</em>
<blockquote>
	<p>Firstly, you need to make clear the extent of every quotation. However 
	many citations you have, the above examples should have quotation marks to 
	show how long the quotation actually is: the reader may infer that it ends 
	where the citation is, but where does it start? [An alternative, with longer 
	quotations, is to use indentation to set out clearly which is the quotation 
	and which your own text. Or you might even get away with the use of italic, 
	but I wouldn't recommend that!]</p>
	<p>As for number of citations, I'm afraid you need one for each quotation. I 
	suppose you could reduce it by using ellipses: &quot;sentence 1 ... sentence 2&quot; 
	[1] , but I'd only do that if there was a small bit missed out, not, for 
	example, if sentence 1 came from chapter 1 of a book and sentence 2 from 
	chapter 7! The other thing I'd ask is whether you really need quotations, or 
	could you paraphrase? And remember that you're going to get more credit for 
	your analysis of the text, rather than for your choice of which sentences to 
	quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Aut/7/mon</h1>
<em>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p wrap>Is there any specific requirement for font (for example ariel, 12) 
	and margin?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</em>
<blockquote>
	<p>There's none given in the assessment paper, so No. (But I am unlikely to 
	be happy with a report that I need a magnifying glass to read!) </p>
