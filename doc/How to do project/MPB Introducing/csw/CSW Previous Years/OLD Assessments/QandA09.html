<b> LAST DAY FOR QUESTIONS: 19 JANUARY 2009 </b>
<p>
These are questions and answers about the CSW
assessment for 2008-09.

<p>
Questions must be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:king@cs.york.ac.uk">king@cs.york.ac.uk</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Questions will not be answered after Spr/2/Mon, Monday 19 January 2009.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Questions will always be answered on this page, not necessarily directly to the 
questioner.

</p>
<p>
Questions and their answers are given in reverse order of their
answering. The dates are the dates that the answer is posted, not that
when the question is asked.  Questions will be made anonymous when
transcribed here.
</p>
<p>
You may find it helpful to see questions that have been asked in previous years, 
when the rubrics have been very similar.

<div>
	I presume that the lit review is not required to be just plain text i.e. 
	pseudocode/equations/examples/algorithms etc are permitted.</div>
<div>
	Is that correct?</div>
</em>
<p>
It certainly is correct: whatever text / diagrams / equations etc are needed to 
construct the review should be used!</p>

<em>
<div>
	I am doing a self defined project next year and so have to do research
	into that area to come up with the project. I was wondering if I could use
	the area of the project as the area for my literature review, or if the
	topic must come almost verbatim from the pages of the research groups in
	the department or the staff members.</div>
</em>
<p>If I were answering back when you first asked the question, I'd probably have 
said: you must do what the assessment rubric says, ie 'from the research groups 
and staff in them'. But my answer now must be slightly more 'relaxed'!<br>
<br>
As long as you can clearly identify an area, and papers in that area, then 
that's fine.</p>

<li>
<div>
	<i>I'm&nbsp; currently sorting my CSW layout in latex and noted the footnote on 
	p6&nbsp; 
	that advised the plain latex style is more compact. Does this mean we&nbsp;
	can use the plain style? I was under the assumption that we had to use&nbsp;
	the UoY layout but I&quot;m often wrong on these things.</i>
	<p>No, you don't 
	*have* to use any particular style. We are a very non-prescriptive 
	department ... in general! :-)<br>
	<br>
	Actually, reading the footnote again, it could be clearer: it is not 
	referring to the 'plain' TeX style, but the 'article' style for LaTeX (on 
	which JLJ's project style is based).<br>
