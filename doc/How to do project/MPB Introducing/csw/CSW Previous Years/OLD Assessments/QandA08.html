<em>
<p>Whilst on the stage of formatting for this assessment I was wondering if
there is a ready template that you would rather we use. We were prescribed
a specific format and template for an assessment submitted earler.
</p>
</em>
<p>
I am not aware of anything in the assesesment that implies a set
style.  (There is a warning that the Department's "project" style
prepared By J. Jacob has a lot of white space in it!).  However,
please pay VERY careful attention to the length and structure set out
in the assessment.  As the assessment makes clear, these are
mandatory, and marks will be lost for not following them.

Is it OK if the papers we review for the CSW assignment are not
recent? I ask because review papers of the type we've been assigned
are usually written about the current state of the particular research
area, and I've found an interesting subject for which a large number
of papers were written in the early to mid 90s. Would it be acceptable
to write my review using some of these old papers? Question

</p>
</em>
<p>
I am not aware of anything in the assesesment that requires only
recent papers to be considered.  It is worth noting, however, that
since CS is a rapidly developing subject area, a review of early work
would be expected (in general - ie not just in the context of the CSW
assessment ) to justify the earliness as well as other aspects.

<p>

I have selected a topic in which I was previously interested.  At the
time, I asked a member of staff for a list of papers that they thought
would be relevant. Is it appropriate for me to use these in my
assessment? Obviously there were many more papers than are required
for the project, so I would be making my own selection from the list.
</p>
</em>
<p>
This is appropriate.  It is not unusual, when doing an academic
literature review, to ask other people in the field what papers they
recommend; it's actually not that different to consulting a lecturer's
publications list on the web.  The key thing is that you are making
the academic judgement about which papers to include in your review.
</p>

<h1>/Aut/10/Tues</h1><ul>

<em>
<p>

Is a cover page / title page required?  If one is required, does it count as one of the 6 A4 pages allowed, leaving just 4 pages for the actual content as 1 page must contain only the bibliography? 
</p>
</em>
<p>
The requirements are precisely as stated in the assessment: ie, no
cover page is required.  If you include one, it will count towards
page and word limits (as it would in the final project report).

<p>
Can my supervisor review my draft?

</p>
</em>
<p>
Again, I've had several requests like this.
<p>
As with all other assessments, it is not appropriate for your
supervisor to comment on your submission.
<p>
On the other hand, you could talk to your supervisor about what, in
general terms, comprises a good literature review... just as, in earlier
years, you could have asked a supervisor about general programming
issues or testing issues during a programming assessment.
<p>
I've tried to capture the essence of what I think a good literature
review is in the way that I have written the assessment.  If there are
particular phrases of the assessment question/guidelines that are
unclear, do mail about these!

<p>
Can you review a draft for me?

</p>
</em>
<p>
I've had several requests to review drafts of the assessment.  I
cannot do this within the confidentiality requirements of the
assessment.  The best advice I can give is that you make sure that you
carefully read and follow the guidelines in the assessment.

I seem to have quite a few big charts and tables taking up space in my CSW literature review. Is it possible to move them into an appendix? What are the restrictions regarding this?
</p>
</em>
<p>
There is no formal provision for appendices, but clearly it would not
be good style to have supplementary material "cluttering up" the
text.  
<p>
My advice is as follows, and is based in part on the Handbook
directions for appendix use in PR5: 
<br>(a) Use a (marked) appendix if you need to, but keep within the page and
word limit.
<br>(b) Make sure that the inclusion of "big charts and tables" is
actually necessary for the review - would a smaller summary be
appropriate, for example?
<br>(c) If you have diagrams or tables taken unaltered from a source,
that you are just including to help the reader, and do not contribute
otherwise to your review, put these in a <b>clearly-designated</b> "unmarked
appendix", and do not include this in the page and word counts.
<p>
Note that an appendix must be properly referenced, cited, and
annotated, to avoid losing marks.  Unmarked appendices must be
properly cited.

<em>I have read some papers for another assessment: can I use the same
papers for the CSW literature review?
<p>

</p>
</em>
<p>
Yes, so long as the other assessment was not a literature review.  It
is the output that has to differ, not the inputs: there is a
University guideline that the same material cannot be presented for
two qualifications, but if you are using the papers for a different
purpose, you are not in breach of this guideline.  (By analogy, if you
had two assessments on one module, or if your final project were on a
topic also covered by a module, you would undoubtedly use some of the
same sources, but you would be using them for a different purpose.)

<em>
Is 'Artifical Immune Systems and their Use in Information Processing' too
large a topic? or should it be 'The use of AISIID in web mining'?
<p>
'Cryptographic APIs' or could it be larger 'An analysis of various
methods of Crypotography and its Interfaces' or more specific 'Microsoft's
Crypotgraphic APIs' (as they have a couple of varying versions, due to
the new release of vista and .NET).
<p>
I'm just trying to find something commercially practical, but within the
scope of the project.  I'd like it to be security systems based, but I'm
not sure how deep into it you'd like.

<p>

</p>
</em>
<p>
Can I turn the problem round, please.  The assessment requires you to
do and present a literature review.  The marks are for review, not for
subject area.  If you can find two or three papers from which you can
construct a coherent academic review, as described in the assessment,
then you have found an aspect (focus) for your review; you also need
some general stuff to reference when you introduce the subject, but
that's unlikely to be a problem.
<p>
The Microsoft topics are the only ones that I would have any concerns
about: the issue here is not whether the subject/aspect is right, but
whether there are two or three <i>academic</i> papers that can be used to
construct a suitable review (it would not matter if introductory
material were taken from more pop-press sources, but the review should
be genuinely academic papers (eg. from conferences, academic journals,
academic books etc).
<p>
So, in short, don't worry about scope and depth; worry about whether
you have suitable sources to review!  Note that the marking scheme
refers to features of academic review, not features of
subject/content/depth/challenge etc.

<p>
I am having difficulty deciding on a subject area for my CSW
assessment. The assessment guidlines read that I "must select a
subject area". Does this mean an item from the list of research areas
from a group, or can I cross research areas or even groups? These
research areas are quite general, so should I write something that
gives an overview of the area, or can I focus in on something more
specific? Is it possible for me to ask you if you think a topic is
appopriate, or would this violate the anonymity policy?
</p>
</em>
<p>
I've had several mails on similar lines.  I do not want to be
over-restrictive on the area you chose.  I am aware that some people
already have a specific area of interest (some already have before
they come here!); such people tend to have an idea of who is working
in that area and where to look for papers.  Other people may just have
a general idea of what they might be interested in, and could use the
department research pages to try to focus in and find papers.
<p>
If you have a research interest that is not obviously covered by one
of our research groups, or that cuts across research groups, and you are confident that you can identify an
aspect and suitable papers, I would certainly not discourage you from
picking that area!
<p>
A good review of this length would typically need a fairly narrow
focus (that is the aspect, referred to in the assessment), but I guess
for many people they will have to arrive at that focus by working down
from a more general idea - for instance, real time, to real time java,
to ravenscar; natural computation to bio-inspired algorithms to ant
navigation inspired... etc.  (And, note, that it can be quite hard to
construct a decent review if you pick two or three papers by the same
authors, as they tend to take very similar standpoints etc).
<p>
I am happy to answer (and record on this page) questions along the
lines of "is this a suitable subject area" (the answer is likely to be
yes, but, as you can see from the above, that would still mean that
you need to find an aspect to review!).  I am happy to answer
questions along the lines of "does subject area z count as a research area, or
is it just journalism"!  
<p>
I <b>cannot</b> answer questions on whether "aspect x" is suitable, or
"papers a, b and c" are suitable.  At the level of the papers and
review focus, suitability is determined by how you go about the
review, not an arbitrary decision by an outsider.
