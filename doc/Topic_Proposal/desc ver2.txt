The application could be described as "A web-based revision controlling and workload allocating aid application for file based work"
This project is not concentrate on software engineering, and may have many drawbacks in comparing with traditional revision control softwares. However, this project will work out a easy to use web bases interface with extensive applicability in any file based work, such as imaging editing, sound processing, report writing, etc.

Here are some useful references:

# the most widely used software based open-source collaboration system, support by lots of IDEs, but only focus on software engineering

I have attached a initial functional idea map of this project's objectives.


可以申请做交叉overlap，需要leader审批，并自动添加进备注
可以manage task，
1. 设置brench tasks with relationship
2. 更改设置，如task名，due，allocate，

创建完 会显示分配表 每个组员可以看到

组长可以看到所有人的进度
task还有1/3时间到期时


最后 combine task
