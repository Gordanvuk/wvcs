<h2>Self-defined: Web-based version control software</h2>
<p>Group student projects, such as that in
<a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/swi/">SWI</a>, can suffer from problems 
of version control (<a href="#wilson1991">Wilson, 1991</a>)- different students making incompatible changes to files. 
The objective of this project would be to build a web-based tool to be used to 
overcome this. There are a number of existing tools and this project will build 
on the literature (e.g. <a href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/">CVS</a>,
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a>, SCCS: <a href="#rochkind1997">Rochkind, 1975</a>).</p>
<p>There are different aspects and approaches to this kind of system. A simple 
approach is to assign roles to different team members and to assign different 
corresponding files to them. Thus, for instance, one member might be working on 
the front-end of a software system. They will have one or more files which 
constitute that module and they alone will be allowed write-access to those 
files. Such a system requires user authentication and management of the users&#39; 
capabilities. An alternative approach is to keep track of the changes to files 
(deltas) so that any version can be recreated at any time. If different people 
are allowed to make simultaneous changes, though, they may be incompatible. In 
that case it may be necessary to have a check-in and -out mechanism to prevent 
parallel access.</p>
<p>One of the first objectives of this project would be to ascertain what kind 
of system would be appropriate for us in SWI.</p>
<p>The plan is specifically to build a web-based system.&nbsp; The advantages of a web-based system are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is no need for software installation.</li>
	<li>Users can access it from anywhere.</li>
	<li>It will be easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plan</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Literature review: finding out about existing systems and approaches.</li>
	<li>Requirements analysis - mainly with students.</li>
	<li>Initial design.</li>
	<li>Prototype implementation and testing.</li>
	<li>Re-design.</li>
	<li>High-fidelity prototype implementation.</li>
	<li>Evaluation</li>
	<li>Write-up</li>
</ol>
<p>The high-fidelity prototype will be built using PHP and mySQL with JavaScript and possibly 
Ajax, as appropriate.</p>
