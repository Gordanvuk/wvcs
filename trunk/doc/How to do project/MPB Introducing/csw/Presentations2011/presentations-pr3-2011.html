Presentations </h1>
<p>All students taking PR3/PR4 will make an unassessed presentation in Autumn 
  week 3. 3rd year MEng students and MSc students will do assessed presentations 
  in the spring term. The remainder of this page applies to PR3/PR4 students.</p>
<h2>PR3/PR4 student presentations</h2>
<p>The timetabled slots and the group allocation for the presentations are given 
  on the main CSW webpage. If you have problems with the timetable, please find 
  a student in another session to swap with, and let me know by email of the changes 
  by Friday 21st (6.00 pm).</p>
<p>Each student will make a 8 minute presentation, using a set of PowerPoint (or 
  other application) slides. They may also give the audience any material on paper 
  they think would be useful for the audience to look at during the presentation 
  (this is unlikely, but if you have a table or something that is too detailed 
  to present as a slide). At the end of each presentation there will be 2 minutes 
  for questions and discussion.</p>
<p> The audience will be the lecturer, 1 or 2 demonstrators, and the other students 
  in the group. 
<p> Students should email their slides to Stefano Pirandola <a href="mailto:pirs@cs.york.ac.uk"> 
  pirs@cs.york.ac.uk</a> at least 24 hours before their presentation slot, so 
  we can be sure that they will run. The email should also state which session 
  the slides are for. 
<h2>Presentation Plan and Timings</h2>
<p> The presentation should review one key paper (or at most two) from your literature 
  review. The presentation itself should have the following four elements: 
<ol>
  <li> Paper details: author, title, publication details 
  <li> Context: a brief statement of the area of computer science, and general 
    background to the paper 
  <li> Content: what the paper covers 
  <li> Critical evaluation: merits and demerits of the paper, concluding comments
</ol>
<p> Content review should outline the underlying theme(s) of the paper, and perhaps 
  illustrate a small example of what is covered.
<p>Evaluation should contain critiques of the paper - can be positive or negative, 
  what is most interesting/wrong etc with the paper. Is it advanced/trivial; easy 
  read/unnecessarily complex etc....who should use the paper, and for what. Is 
  the paper useful for further advances in the field?
<p> As a rough guide, the paper details can be just displayed (at most 1 minute); 
  the context should take 2 minutes; the content should take about 3 minutes, 
  and the evaluation about 2 minutes.
<p> Note that this structure suggests a few slides (roughly one per minute). 
<p>At the end of the presentation, there will be a couple of minutes for questions 
  from lecturer/demonstrators and possibly from the audience too.
<h2>Presentation Feedback</h2>
<p> The presentation is not formally assessed, but completed <A
  href="MarkingSheet2011.pdf">feedback sheets</A> will be returned to students. 
<p> 
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p> PR3/PR4 students will receive written feedback (the form is linked, above). 
  It will be avalaible at the end of week 3.
