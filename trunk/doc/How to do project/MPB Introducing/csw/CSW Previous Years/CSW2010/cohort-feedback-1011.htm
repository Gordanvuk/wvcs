<h1>General comments on CSW written assessment</h1>

<p>There were several very well-written reports very interesting to read.
However, some students did a bad job, ignoring the 
guidelines stated on the assessment. In a few cases,
marks have been reduced as a result of over-running the maximum 
number of words and pages.</p>

<p>Here I have listed some of the basic problems I found.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Context (introduction)</li>
</ul>
<p>This part was supposed to lead the reader gradually from the broad research 
  area to the specific papers reviewed. Sometimes the general area was not discussed 
  at all. In some cases intro was quite vague, just made by general statements 
  on the current the state of art in computer industry... In some other cases, 
  the introduction was just an anticipation of the specific content of the papers.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Content (papers reviewed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing without grammatical errors was not a sufficient condition
to get a good mark.
Some students did not find the right balance between simply stating 
what was in the papers and critically writing about them
(by analysing their contents and comparing them).
Also selecting the right arguments from the reviewed
papers was to be considered as an important step.
In some cases, details from the papers were just cut
and pasted in the review, with a few students 
using a huge number of floating citations.... </p>
  

<ul>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion was usually the weakest part.
The main goal of this section was to 
summarise the key points of the review, in order
to make a proposal of suggestion for further research.
This step needed some critique on the papers
e.g., based on some disageement between them,
or because of a particular issue not covered etc...

Unfortunately, in several cases, critique
and future directions were not sufficiently developed.
In a few cases, conclusion was only intended as a 
schematic summary of the reviewed papers. </p>


<ul>
  <li>Bibliography</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the most common problem was lack of detail. 
In some cases, people simply gave authors and title, with no indication of date, publisher, 
whether it was a book or a paper etc...
For instance, a reference for a paper in a set of conference proceedings should have the 
details of the paper itself (title, author, and so on) and the details of the whole 
proceedings (title, editor, date, publisher, possibly place of the conference).</p>


<p>Besides the points above, there were other important issues:</p>


<p>- <strong>Plagiarism</strong>. In many cases, ideas and discussions were not 
  properly cited. I found a non-trivial number of quotations and figures without 
  a proper reference. Several students assumed that giving the authors (with no 
  citation) was sufficient to identify the source. You must use the citation, 
  every time you refer to a paper or something directly or indirectly taken from 
  it.</p>
<p>- <strong>Quotations</strong>. Avoid to use quotations if you can. A quotation 
  should be used only as a key-point in developing your argument. Their number 
  should be very limited. In some cases, there was a real abuse with entire sections 
  built on quotations!</p>


<p>- <strong>Narrative style</strong>. Lit review is NOT a personal narrative. 
  Despite a certain amout of "I's" is tolerable, you should be as much impersonal 
  as possible. Thus, wordings such as "I feel" are not appropriate. Some students 
  wrote extremely convoluted sentences (sometimes 7-8 lines long). Academic writing 
  is made by short and clear sentences. </p>


<p>- <strong>Non-academic English</strong>. There were several submissions using 
  an imprecise language. Note that by this I do not mean non-native-speaker mistakes. 
  Examples include:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of short forms for the verbs.</li>
      <li>Wrong punctuaction, including the use of "dashes" instead of commas 
        or semicolons.</li>
      <li>Use of "&" instead of "and".</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other (minor) points:</p>

<p>- Sections and informative subheadings. These things help to give structure to the review.
Some students presented a unique section with no clear distinction between intro, content
and conclusion.</p>  

<p>- Title. This is something helpful! 
There were many submissions starting just with 'CSW Open Assessment'.</p>








<h1>General comments on CSW assessed presentations </h1>
<p>The presentations were all very interesting! They were also good with an average 
  mark around 7.15 out of 10. For each student, the final mark has been computed 
  as an average between the marks of me, Malihe Tabatabaie and Sam Devlin. The 
  &quot;content&quot; of the presentation (i.e., the actual discussion of the 
  papers reviewed) was good for almost everyone. In general, problems were found 
  for the &quot;context&quot; of the presentation (someone did not introduce the 
  general area in a clear way) and also for the conclusion/critical evaluation, 
  where discussion of possible future directions and critique of the papers were 
  missing sometimes. However, we have clearly considered the constraint of the 
  time...The slides were generally good and clear. Someone should try to be more 
  confident in front of an audience, trying to speak louder and looking at the 
  audience during the presentation!</p>
