<h1>General comments on CSW written assessment</h1>
<p>
Whilst literature review is a skill that many people do not have
naturally, the assessment was very carefully worded, to lead through
the process of selecting papers, reviewing them, and writing what was
required. 
<p>
The people who did badly were typically those who did not
follow the brief: those who did not provide critical insight,
comparison etc. 
<ul>
<li>Writing an elegant precis was not sufficient to get a
good mark!  
<li>Despite the explicit statement of how and when to cite (section
1.4 of the assessment) and all the effort put in to educating students
about plagiarism, a number of offerings had uncited material: several
amount to plagiarism of diagrams, formulae, and ideas. Several
students ignored the injunction to cite every citable instance, and
others assumed that giving the authors (with no citation) was
sufficient to identify the source.  You must use the citation, in
whatever style you chose, every time you refer to a paper or something
directly or indirectly taken from it.
</ul>
<p>
There were a number of submissions in dubious or non-academic English,
specifically, lazy or imprecise language. Note that by this I do not
mean non-native-speaker mistakes.  Examples include:
<ul>
<li> Use of short
forms (it's for it is; 3rd for third; numbers given as numerals not
words)
<li> Slang terms (eg. kinda, sort of) and meaningless or
irritating extra words (eg.  obviously)
<li> Personalisation: things like "I will try to", not valid critique.
</ul>
Some submissions started with generalisations about the state or
development of the computer industry etc., which are simply a waste of
words and the reader's patience in a short academic submission (unless
is is about the state of commercial computing, and substantiated with
cited evidence.)  
<p>
Conclusion was usually the weakest part, with little
attention paid to the remit, "...summarising the key points from the
review, and making a proposal of suggestion for further research
...". In many cases, the conclusion reported the conclusions of the
papers reviewed; in others, it was used to provide critical comment,
that rightly belonged in the main review (section 2). 
<ul>
<li>Some people
ignored the request for a proposal or further work suggestion.  This
was intended to help you to focus on where the papers were leading
(areas of disagreement that could be resolved; complementarity that
could be exploited etc)!
</ul>
