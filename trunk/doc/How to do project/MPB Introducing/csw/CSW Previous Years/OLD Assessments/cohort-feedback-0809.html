<h1>General comments on CSW written assessment</h1>
<p>The first thing to note is that I actually found marking the reports for this 
assessment very interesting, unlike most other marking I have to do! There were some very well-written reports and, in almost 
all cases, I learnt a fair amount from what I was reading: thank you!</p>
<p>The two areas where there was, in general, most room for improvement were the 
level of analysis, and the bibliography.</p>
<p>As far as the level of analysis is concerned, some people found it hard to 
get the right balance between simply stating what was in a reviewed paper and 
writing about that content, perhaps comparing to other papers. Given that you 
were (deliberately) under such a tight limit on space, it was important to get 
this right: there was often simply not enough room both to give a detailed 
description of the content of the papers and to analyse the content. In some 
cases, students chose to leave in the detail about the papers: this was almost 
always a mistake, because it meant either that there was no analysis or that 
there was no high-level, abstract description of the topic area, which meant 
loss of marks. This judgement about what to put in and what to leave out is very 
difficult: it may be easier in a project report where many more pages are 
available, but there will be much more to fit in and similar judgements will 
need to be made. It is worth remembering what Pascal wrote (in 1660): &quot;I made 
this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter.&quot; 
[Provincial Letters, XVI]. Having done the reading, thinking and initial writing, 
you need to allow time to make the judgements about what stays in and what is 
taken out.</p>
<p>In the bibliography section, the most common problem was lack of detail: 
there were many occasions where insufficient detail was given for a particular 
reference. In extreme cases, people simply gave an author and a title, with no 
indication of date, publisher, whether it was a book or a paper, and so on. In 
other cases, although some detail was given, there was not enough. For instance, 
a reference for a paper in a set of conference proceedings should have the 
details of the paper itself (title, author, and so on) and the details of the 
whole proceedings (title, editor, date, publisher, possibly place of the 
conference). In some reports, there was an over-reliance on online sources: as 
mentioned in the lectures, the problems with such sources is that the reader 
cannot conclude much about the 'quality' of the source. If a paper appears in a 
journal or in conference proceedings, then it is very likely to have been 
peer-reviewed. So if you find an online source, you should consider whether 
there is a 'better' peer-reviewed version, and use that reference instead. Since 
the purpose of referring to sources is to add weight to your argument, you 
should be aiming to use those references that have the most academic credibility 
since that is what will help your case the most. The other point I noted about 
bibliographies was that some students were not consistent in their presentation 
of references. For instance, some references had authors' initials appearing 
after the surname (Bloggs, F.) while others had the initials before the surname 
(F. Bloggs). I didn't penalise for either choice, but I did for those who used 
both forms! [The recent YUSU-led Academic Integrity Week has led to the 
production of some useful resources on referencing, available from the website

<p>Some minor points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>some authors used subheadings within the review to give structure: this 
	was very effective, breaking up what could have been 3 pages of text into 
	smaller chunks</li>
	<li>some authors has no overall title (other than 'CSW Open Assessment'): 
	this didn't make it easy to work out the subject area</li>
	<li>it was good to see, in some cases, comments about the date of 
	publication of the papers: this is an important part of the 'context' of the 
	papers</li>
	<li>in some cases, the quality of the English was really not very good: 
	there were sentences without verbs, singular verbs with plural nouns (and 
	vice versa), mis-spellings of words, and so on. If you are not confident in 
	your writing, you really need to take the time to do some proof-reading, or 
	to get someone else to proof-read. If you submit project reports with such 
	problems, you are likely to be penalised, not least because reading a report 
	riddled with errors is much harder for the marker.</li>
</ul>

<h1>General comments on CSW assessed presentations </h1>
<p>The presentations were, on the whole, interesting and fun to listen to! Once 
again, the major problem was how to deal with the constraint of time, and how to 
decide what to leave in and what to take out. The slides used were generally 
good and clear.</p>
