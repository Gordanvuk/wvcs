<h2>Assessment Feedback 2005-06</h2>

<p>There were a lot of very good reviews, this year.  There were fewer
dire ones than last year, and a relatively low level of sloppy
presentation.

<p>Revised marking criteria this year allowed some people to score well
because their presentation and referencing was good, rather than
because they produced good reviews.  These are reported in individual
feedback.

<p>A few people were still unable to follow the given structure, despite dire
threats in lectures.  The clearly delimited structure and requirements
for each section were put there to help students present the review in
a conventional way, recognising that most students have not had much
experience in this area.

<p>It is clear that a number of people have not spent much of the assumed
90 non-contact hours of CSW researching literature review.  The
lectures explained the need to present coherent argument, not precis,
recommended students to study past projects, and gave annotated lists
of the best projects for the various degrees in recent years.

<p>Some people are still not taking note of how to use citation, despite
a whole lecture on this.

<p>The commonest problem overall was presenting precis not review.  Many
assessments had two or three successive precis, sometimes with
personal commentary, but nothing that pulled together the points,
coverage, or issues.  A few exacerbated the problem by providing the
review discussion in the conclusion (where it was penalised as new
material).

<p>A small number of students are in serious need to help (or hard work)
on presentation and writing.  These are noted in individual feedback.
These students will have problems with open assessments and PR5 next
year if they cannot write more clearly, correctly and  concisely.

<p>Please note the <a href="http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/csw/grammar.html">citation and writing</a> information (extracted from
last year's feedback).
