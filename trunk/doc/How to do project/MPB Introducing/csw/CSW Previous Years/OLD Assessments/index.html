<h2>Assessment questions</h2>
<p>I expect a number of questions to be emailed to me. These will be found, 
together with answers, at <a href="QandAs.html">this page</a>. Answers to 
questions posed in previous years are linked below.</p>
<h2>Handin of written report</h2>
<p>All students should 
submit a printed copy of their report to the Office, as usual. In addition, an 
electronic copy of the report should be submitted via the Electronic Submission 
mechanism <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/submit/openassess.html">here</a>. 
These electronic versions will be used for Plagiarism Checking, probably via two 
search tools, Safe Assign and Turnitin. <b>&nbsp;</b>The format of the electronic version 
should be: 'something sensible'. This can include:</p><font COLOR="#211d1e">
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#211d1e">
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Word® (including Word 2007)</font><font COLOR="#211d1e"></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">Corel WordPerfect®</font></li>
	</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#211d1e">

	<li>Adobe PostScript®</li>
	<li>Plain text (TXT)</li>
	<li>Rich Text Format (RTF)</font><font COLOR="#211d1e"></li>

<h2>Schedule for Presentations</h2>
<p>The CSW presentations take place in week 4, Spring term: the sessions are on 
Thursday and Friday (4th and 5th February). </p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="pres-spr10.pdf">Allocation to slots </a>is now available. 
	<blink><b>NB This has had to be revised due to clashes. Please check 
	carefully. </b></blink>Scheduling is quite tight, so please arrive promptly for your session. </li>
	<li>You should attend the whole of your allocated session. The order of 
	presentation will be the order in which names are listed, unless anyone has 
	a pressing need to change the order. </li>
	<li>If you cannot attend your allocated session, please email me urgently, 
	and <b>no later than Wednesday week 4</b>, stating why you cannot make the 
	allocated session, and which other sessions you are available for. </li>
	<li>Details of the rooms in which presentations are taking place can be 
	found on the University web site,
	<a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/estates/roombookings/">
	http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/estates/roombookings/</a>: </li>
	<li>Presentations will be formally assessed by Steve King, and one 
	demonstrator; the allocated demonstrator is Clement Creusot. In addition, 
	all students attending each session will be expected to provide informal 
	feedback (not contributing to the mark) for all other students.</li>
	<li>Each student will make a 5 minute presentation, using a set of 
	PowerPoint (or other application) slides. They may also give the audience 
	any material on paper they think would be useful for the audience to look at 
	during the presentation (this is unlikely, but may be relevant if you have a 
	table or something that is too detailed to present as a slide). </li>
	<li>Students should email their PowerPoint (or other application) slides to 
	Steve King <a href="mailto:king@cs.york.ac.uk">king@cs.york.ac.uk</a>, 
	ideally at least 24 hours before their presentation slot but certainly 12 
	hours before, so we can be sure that they will run. The email should also 
	state which session the slides are for.</li>
	<li>The presentation should review one, or at most two, key papers from your 
	literature review. It should cover:
	<ul>
		<li>topic of the paper/s - this can be your title slide </li>
		<li>author/s and title of the paper/s brief description of what the 
		paper/s are about, focussing on the part/s you are most interested in 
		</li>
		<li>some critique of the paper/s - can be positive or negative, what is 
		most interesting/wrong etc with the paper/s (this is the meat of the 
		presentation, so might be two slides </li>
		<li>conclusion
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that this structure suggests 4 or 5 slides. Remember that I 
	suggested that you should not aim for much more than 1 slide per minute, so 
	for a 5 minute talk, this is about all you need. </li>
	<li>Feedback: all students giving presentations will receive written 
	feedback afterwards. However, please note that it is likely to be late in 
	week 5 or early in week 6 before it can be collated and distributed.</li>
</ul>
