<h2>Assessment questions</h2>
<p>A small number of questions have been emailed to me. These can be found, 
together with answers, at <a href="QandA09.html">this page</a>. Although I will 
not be answering any more questions about the written part of the assessment, I 
am willing to make clarifications about the presentations if necessary.</p>
<h2>Handin of written report</h2>
<p>All students should 
submit a printed copy of their report to the Office, as usual. In addition, an 
electronic copy of the report should be submitted via the Electronic Submission 
mechanism <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/submit/openassess.html">here</a>. 
These electronic versions will be used for Plagiarism Checking, probably via two 
search tools, Safe Assign and Turnitin. Since these engines could not be set up 
in time, I will make the submissions myself. The main purpose of these checks is 
to evaluate and compare the two tools, but if any any plagiarism cases are 
uncovered, they will certainly be investigated! <b>Formally, I need to ask your 
permission to use your submissions for this purpose: if you have any problem 
with this, please email me to let me know what the problem is. For Turnitin, you 
should be aware that the default behaviour is for any paper that is submitted 
for checking to be added to the collection of papers against which any 
subsequent submission is checked. </b>The format of the electronic version 
should be: 'something sensible'. This can include:</p><font COLOR="#211d1e">

<h2>Schedule for Presentations</h2>
<p>
The CSW presentations take place in week 4, Spring term: the sessions
are on Thursday and Friday (5th and 6th February).
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pres-spr09.pdf">Allocation
    to slots </a>is now available.  Scheduling is quite tight, so
  please arrive promptly for your session.
  <li> You should attend the whole of your allocated session.  The
  order of presentation will be the order in which names are listed,
  unless anyone has a pressing need to change the order.
  <li> If you cannot attend your allocated session, please email me
  urgently, and <b>no later than Friday week 3</b>, stating why you cannot
  make the allocated session, and which other sessions you are
  available for.
    <li> Details of the rooms in which presentations are taking place
    can be found on the University web site, <a
HREF="http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/estates/roombookings/">http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/estates/roombookings/</a>:
<li> Presentations will be formally assessed by Steve King, and one
  demonstrator; the allocated demonstrators are Ahmad Shahid and Teodor Ghetiu. 
In addition, all students attending each session will be expected to provide 
informal feedback (not contributing to the mark) for all other students.<li> Each student will make a 5 minute presentation, using a set of PowerPoint (or other application) slides.  
They may also give the audience any material on paper they think would be useful for the audience to look at during the presentation 
(this is unlikely, but may be relevant if you have a table or something that is too detailed to present as a slide).
<li> Students should email their PowerPoint (or other application) slides to Steve 
King <a href="mailto:king@cs.york.ac.uk">king@cs.york.ac.uk</a>
at least 24 hours before their presentation slot, so we can be sure that they will run.

The email should also state which session the slides are for.<li> <p>
The presentation should review one, or at most two, key papers from your literature review.  It should cover:
<ul>
<li>
topic of the paper/s - this can be your title slide
<li>
author/s and title of the paper/s
brief description of what the paper/s are about, focussing on the part/s you are most interested in
<li>
some critique of the paper/s - can be positive or negative, what is most interesting/wrong etc with the paper/s 
(this is the meat of the presentation, so might be two slides
<li>
conclusion
</ul>
<p>

Note that this structure suggests 4 or 5 slides.  Remember that I suggested that you should not aim for much more than 1 slide per minute, so for a 5 minute talk, this is about all you need.

<li>Feedback: all students giving presentations will receive written feedback 
afterwards. However, please note that it is likely to be late in week 5 or early 
in week 6 before it can be 
collated and distributed.</li>
