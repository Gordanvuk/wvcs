Thanks for this query. I'll put some clarification up on the website. 

Both marks (mine + demonstrator's) will be used, and the mean will be taken.
But it's only the overall mark that's used, not the signals in the 3
areas. This is the same technique that's used on the project report
writing: we give signals in various areas, but the overall mark is not
derived algorithmically from these. (There's plenty of evidence from
places that use an algorithm that markers adjust their 'sub-marks' so
that the overall mark is what they want, which seems perverse to us!) 

I've looked at the differences between my mark and the demonstrators'
marks, and there's not a significant difference. But I'm not surprised
that there is *some* difference: marking presentations is an inherently
subjective activity, which is why we don't often make it a significant
part of an assessment (10% of CSW, 5% of projects, etc). 

I hope that helps to clarify things, and I apologise that it wasn't
clearer from the outset. Please shout if there's anything still unclear.
