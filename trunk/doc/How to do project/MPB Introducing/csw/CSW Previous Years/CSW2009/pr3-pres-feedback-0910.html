<h1>Unassessed CSW presentations, for PR3-ers</h1>
<p>The presentations were, on the whole, interesting and fun to listen to! </p>
<p>On the positive side, almost all of the slides used were clear and 
well-designed. However, there were a very few cases where diagrams were rather 
small and hard to read. Almost all students spoke clearly and enthusiastically.</p>
<p>For such short presentations (the assessed ones next term are twice as long, 
at 10 minutes + questions), the judgement about what to put in and what to leave 
out is very important. Some people didn't leave space for their own critique of 
the paper(s), giving only a summary of the content: I think that was a wrong 
decision! It was also noticeable that many presentations finished significantly 
before the allotted 5-minute time had expired: what a waste! It is always worth 
practising a presentation in advance, to get the timing right, and you should 
remember the effect of adrenalin: you are likely to speak faster in a slightly 
stressed situation, so this should be taken into account when working out 
timings.</p>
