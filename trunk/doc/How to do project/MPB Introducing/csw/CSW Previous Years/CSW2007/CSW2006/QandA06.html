<h2> Questions and answers: Open Assessment </h2>
<p>
Question: With respect to the CSW assessment and the 5 marks being awarded for quality of presentation and argument, would the choice of the type of the submission, i.e either in Microsoft Word or LATEX, impact on the number of marks awarded in this section, for example, if we choose to write our presentation in Microsoft Word, will we be deducted marks in this section, as the final presentation may not look as 'elegant' as one in LATEX?
<p>
Answer: Quality of presentation will be judged relative to the presentation medium chosen.  So if you choose Word, I will judge the document relative to other Word documents, not Latex documents.  If you choose Latex, I will judge it relative to other Latex documents.

<p>
Question: Can I use a couple of images taken from the paper I'm reviewing? Should I
credit/reference these, and if so, where - on the slide I use them, or at
the end?
<p>
Answer: Yes, using images from the paper is fine.  It's best to credit them on the slide where they are used.  If for some reason that really won't work, an acknowledgement at the end of the slides would be OK.
